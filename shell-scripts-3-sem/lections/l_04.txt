bayki pro create OS from scratch == 180 billion dollars

Process management subsystem
    process is a data structure
    PCB - process control block
      process attributes:
        -- context of the process execution
        -- info about associated resources (e.g address space)
        -- story of the process (how the load changes, to help scheduling)
        (get the idea of how fast the process would be)

Memory management subsystem
    virtual memory concept (translator virtual <--> factual)
        spoiler - paging system (recall c++, multilevel page tables)

    securing address (more difficult with paging)

File management subsystem
    transferring data from hardware to USB - completely different organization system(! miracle !)
    rule - logical block is a linear space

    catalog management subsystem - (syn - directory)
        ex: Windows - tree hierarchy, a file can only be located in single directory
            Linux - network hierarchy, a file can lie anywhere


Outer devices management subsystem
    universal mechanism of i\o (data flow to and from)

    driver - software, which knows both about the os and the device

    plug and pray

Data protection and administration subsystem
    lots of users per machie -> we need way to limit and divide their access
    admin + user mechanism

    Windows has admin, but from uzvers even admin is limited
    Linux - root can do everything

    identification = assign id to user, give him id and password once
    authentification = procedure of checking identification
    authorization = give access to user after authentification

    a problem arises when computer cannot track whether user is the same as the one who loginned.

user interface subsystem
    bayki pro integrate bash into windows
    question - gui and command line. What is primary?
