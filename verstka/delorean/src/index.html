                Pennsylvanians are waking up to a tighter presidential race.
                <br> <br>
                The Department of State website shows little change overnight. 
                There are about 29 percent of mail-in votes that still need to be counted, or about 763,000 ballots.

            </h3>
            <p class='par'>
                Democrats maintained their hold on all three seats in Delaware’s congressional delegation 
                by fending off Republican challengers to U.S. Sen. Chris Coons and Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester. 
                Coons has held office since 2010 was challenged by conservative activist and political newcomer 
                Lauren Witzke. Witzke has campaigned on an “America First” platform that includes a 10-year 
                moratorium on immigration. But her campaign positions often were overshadowed by remarks that 
                drew criticism from both Democrats and fellow Republicans. They included online posts celebrating 
                the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and defending the neo-fascist Proud Boys.

                    DOVER, Del. (AP) — This year’s general election in Delaware was like none 
                    ever seen in the state before. Tens of thousands Delawareans took advantage of a universal 
                    voting-by-mail law authorized under emergency powers invoked by the Democrat-controlled 
                    legislature because of the coronavirus. Also for the first time, Delaware’s own Joe Biden 
                    was the Democratic Party’s nominee for president.
