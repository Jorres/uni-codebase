modified: 20210716t18:21:35+03:00# engineering daybook  1 may 23 read an article about pros and cons of monorepo pros involve atomic changes  simplified code reusing simplified dependency management simplicity of massive  (tstroka > std::string) changes downsides include a necessity to centralize  events (google and yandex trunk downside of atomicity) which bottle necks commit  process expenses to run this massive amount of testing and static analysis  (although this downside is in my understanding purely financial there is no reason  not to have it at the large scale) and [update this when you read on the internet  why monorepo is bad from yandex developers] spent several hours programming (pretending to be engineering) a qt application  tried to apply `tell dont ask` principle and to keep code as decoupled as  possible  2 may 24 read a chapter on technical leadership in short:   allow for risk and responsibility ;   dont be a baby sitter ;   dont ignore human issues  3 may 25 read a chapter on macro leadership in short:   no silver bullets you need to experiment around to tackle every issue ;   try to remove you as a single point of failure strive for autonomy ;   be aware of your scarce human resources and drop micromanaging accordingly learned some university math on linear problem optimization  4 may 26 no progress rest day  5 may 27 always try to make a computer to do all the hard work for you if i would have  enabled fsanitizers when solving anias little problem i would have solved it in 2  minutes rather than 10 read a chapter on metrics and measurements in `se at google` in short: measure  when you will take action after learning the result goals/signals/metrics  framework qualitative and quantitative metrics skimmed through `progit` book understood the concept of git as a distributed  service started to read `tmux` book not quite sure why at this point but the research is  going to be cheap only several hours and im committing to it out of curiosity  6 may 28 read `pragmatic programmer` the author states that finite state machines are  underrated and should be used more explicitly i recall my experience when working  with screeps and this statement seems to be true from my experience fsms are easy  to trace and understand practiced negotiation in battle conditions had a talk discussing becoming a cto  or at least acting cto with amin had some nice time customising tmux appearance have to admit though it had little  engineering value second day into the experiment and i still dont understand why  tmux even for ssh arguments from some redditer that seem to come down mostly to  persistence:   when ssh dies your stuff is still just where you left it   when you launch something that enters a tight infinite loop and never comes up    to check for ^c you can kill it super easily   files side by side   when you leave ssh at place a your crap is already set up at place b no more    wasted 5 minutes getting to the right directories and getting your programs    running right and all the files you need opened   sharing screens between 2 people   activity monitor if it writes to stdout and you want to know when it stops you    can be notified if it doesnt and you want to be notified when it does you get    notified   you can spin up the exact terminal state of your development process    automatically like vimsession but expanded to all console applications  7 may 29 had some more time on setting up `tmux` it seems to be fun scripting your  environments spent two hours coding anias simplex but failed miserably to produce anything of  value i started coding right away with only superficial thinking of what i really  needed it looked like i had a plan but it turns out i hadnt maybe it is true  after all that you can learn exclusively on your own mistakes i will try to fix my  approach tomorrow  8 may 30 programmed for 6 hours tried to make an emphasis on engineering rather than  programming made some explicit tradeoffs here and there but overall i think i  built a pretty easytochange infrastructure learned to navigate shell sessions with tmux copymode quickly skimmed on how to setup collaborative sessions with tmux with exceptionally  shit connection bad thing though  no one is going to use it with you cool in  principle pointless in context learned to make nice little ascii diagrams debatable usefulness but it is what  ive always wanted upd: 2 months later: how often did you use this plugin for the  past two month  9 may 31 had my first meeting as an acting cto nothing special nothing radical and yet it  was a unique experience otherwise unfortunately spent not too much time on education  10 june 1 read google sre book not my scale yet this is dangerous to invest in things that  are not your scale programmed my day through the scale of the anias simplex program grows but i find  that is still quite easy to introduce new changes and that these changes are  mostly decoupled and take place one place at a time had some wonderful time finishing off tmux book installed plugins updated configs  with some fun stuff  11 june 2 had a long evening session at mdinc discussing responsibilities it looks like ill  formally be a cto i need a lawyer for reading the contract that is for sure  upd: 2 months later when we started working already even ania does not make moves  to find a lawyer i cant believe humans are so emotionally unstable our  opinions and beliefs change just snap your fingers im terrified of how unstable  i am upd2: this is not instability this is burning out you felt an explicit wish  to do something (read the contract) but you dont now even if you realize with  your mind you absolutely need it your brain just subconsciously discards this as  irrelevant  12 june 3 going to have a meeting with gleb what am i gonna do ask him a series of questions:   tell me about your stack stuff youve written things on   do you know how the web works   whats the difference between java and c++ in your opinion main one   have you ever tried writing multithreaded programs probably in c# ask him to show a piece of code and guide me through it   probably it is going to be ruby it would be honest and interesting and then im going to tell him about things he would have to write in our startup  and his salary what to focus on under no circumstances should he feel bad or miserable i can  smoothen this with a remark before the question (upd: the following thought is  actually quite good) i can mix it up with `tell` questions so he has things to say  and i can gather feedback from him after the session is over programmed my day through again the simplex lab is 1000 lines but it still holds  this ease of change i wonder how long till i forget something  13 june 4 had a lecture on sharding completed one distributed homework  14 june 5 spent a huge amount of time on productive programming its so good it comes right  before me becoming a cto read google sre book  15 june 6 recapped one lecture on concurrent programming repeated the basics relistened to introductory lecture on distributed programming never write a  distributed algorithm unless youre really pressed to do so read google sre book  16 june 7 had spent several hours to find out a good solution for our documentation  solidified my knowledge on web servers application servers static web sites and  static sites generators is this it not knowing how to do anything but starting  to be productive already also messed with markdown for some time will try to keep my documents valid  markdown from now on  17 june 8 with a deep sorrow realized i have much less user visible progress per same unit of  work on anias primary legkov lab it became impossible to hold all the open files  in one tab <==> impossible to hold in my head progress slowed down dramatically too bad im not sure what is the reason for the slowdown yes i spent some time  refactoring things but that is a good thing rather than bad  i couldnt have  predicted all the requirements anyway when i started i believe the reason for a  slowdown is a similar process that happens with caches of the processor  when you  cannot hold everything in your primary cache you slow down by an order of  magnitude anyway i would say it is still completely manageable in terms of architecture with  (for now) minor refactoring here and there i think i can make the most of my code  reusable (natural requirement since fake basis requires base simplex) ill see how  things go  18 june 9 had my first technical interview as an interviewer where i had to reject i have to  admit i cannot afford to teach people everything thus i reject andrew but heres  a template of what you can ask a person in a basic interview:   what youve worked with in your life   what is an api   what is an interface why use interfaces   garbage collector manual memory management   have you ever worked with a multithreading program   mutex   internet dns http tcp udp   any linux experience   lets write a stack pick language   what do you know about testing   lets write unit tests for stack  upd: this decision turned out quite good  19 june 10 had a busy day without any chance to peacefully sit and program for a while i  guess managers just do it partially tried to hire denis but he was unhireable  from the start but that was worth a try now i know what does not work  playing  friendly and introducing good things bit by bit reviewed my first pull request from reviewer side reviewing it was much more  helpful than not reviewing it i did not go through all the logic but i did give  some advice on how to make our codebase better and more consistent  20 june 11 having a great time learning distributed systems learned about how to perform  transactions (centralized one machine per transaction) learned about paxos  alternative called raft and that the only thing that matters is  `how easy you can make your explanation sound` and learned how to dump consistency  in the favor of availability using gossip protocols and cap theorem had an unsuccessful experience hunting tolya what can i learn i failed to hunt 2  impressive people in a row but both rejected why bad timing im sure at my  level i was impressive enough i tried so hard i made mistakes and i will learn  but the most important lesson is  know your timing all the successful people  went for an internship in late june you should have done it earlier many of the  things in the world are easier if you do them earlier i bet you would have a much  greater chance to get them both if you did this earlier fuck im devastated i think i got another important piece of knowledge if you want something your way  when your opponent already decided something you dont have multiphase  negotiations because during breaks your opponent will probably never try to come  up with arguments for you he will try to justify his old choice because humans  are inert the subject approved this although this approval might also be biased  by another bias nvm one more thing that you should remember never phrase your sentences like  `well did you finally decide to dump us for jetbrains)` it may sound humorous  and retain some `i dont really care` attitude but it does a much greater harm by  making easy for your conversation partner to reject you he only had to nod grimly  instead of gathering his will into a fist and telling you he refuses this was how  i started a conversation with tolya today and it was probably not a deciding  factor but it was obvious 100ms later that it was a terribly bad move phrase your  thoughts the way it is easy to agree with you not reject you  21 june 12 found out several years later than i should that bash has two editing modes  vi  and emacs messed with my configs quite a lot introduced a vim to the shell learned how to  work with quickfix list tried a cli email program but quickly vomited and went  away learned about a personal kanban cli tool called `taskell` will probably use  this alongside `task` and `timew` watched one distributed computing lecture about replication why replication how  to do it cap theorem programmed another anias lab and this time oh holy cow code quality is so bad  in a rush for speed i made so many codestyle tradeoffs (and even smallerscale  design decisions) that look farfetched and unnatural and yet everything works  everything depends on the context i had to submit this and i did even if it was a  shitty code it does not matter now  22 june 13 spent two hours toying with cron autopushing directory permissions and quickfix  list adoption it was great now i can be a little less maniac about backing  everything up on time setup ssh connection with my most often used git repos now i just need to brush up  on what ssh is and how it works) helped ania with coding graphical lab apps there are conferences in this world hydra holyjs so many interesting things  tailored to your needs started to watch a presentation on hydra and it turns out  they have entrylevel stuff too starting to be worried about the diploma  23 june 14 realized i only got so much time this moment when you want to create your  organization in a perfect way but you realize you wont be able to pull this thing  off on your own even thorougly reading yacloud manuals will take more than a full  work day and there are many more things to do ill have to learn to delegate watched my first conference lecture in my life quite a milestone although the  topic (paxos and raft in distributed consensus) was tightly coupled to my academic  course on which ill have an exam in a few days i deeply enjoyed it id say even  more than i enjoyed roman elizarovs lectures because of the innate interest you  learn something much much more efficiently if you are not forced to do so if you  have this innate interest instead of the stick part of "stick and carrot" read through the yacloud documentation wow only several hours into the thing and  it feels like i already know the platform i underappreciate stuff written in  russian it feels like i should read and write technical things in english all the  time but you are nowhere near a native speaker at this point and other people  around you are even less so keeping our docs in russian looks like a good  decision i still didnt do the global overview of what well have to do and that is  probably the most important aspect of my job and i keep hammering docs :) although  i think im well suited to do this and it is interesting  24 june 15 had a meeting with nastya yanina "sit in the meetings so that others dont have  to" has never been more precise although we managed to discuss everything in under  15 minutes neat (ive never ever underestimated this huge in my life :)))) continued preparation for distr exam no time or mood to log everything properly  25 june 16 continued preparation for distr exam no time or mood to log everything properly  26 june 17 passed my examinations with flying colors i really loved preparing for it i  listened to several talks on hydra and gathered a lot of insight about the  stateoftheart in both business and theoretical fields of distributed computing learned some deeper things about bitcoin and its theoretical basis turns out it  overcomplicates things and tries to solve an inherently more difficult problem than  it needs to it solves consensus but it can live with a consensus number of one  27 june 18 started to set up yandex cloud environment created a skeleton for a yoda application set up a ci process listened to a talk on graphql found some probable reasons not to proceed with it had several important revelations on the overall view of the project the biggest  one being the problem of delivery of the product to the customers signing up for  this work i didnt think it would be that multifaceted  28 june 19 had been mostly chilling but also smoothening up a ci\cd pipeline for yoda  29 june 20 had discovered a way to create userlike behaviour tests using spectron (selenium  under the hood)  30 june 21 spent a lot of time working out a particularly pesky api deprecation  unfortunately i directly violated the rule of no panicking when debugging and let  my failure in fixing something in an instant to soak into my private life running  my mood for the whole evening  31 june 22 the yesterdays incident looks even more stupid when i was able to fix things  within a very short time in the morning i really need to remember  `dont panic when debugging` rule had proceeded to read and reflect on `the pragmatic programmer` rather than  reflecting on things from the past though might it be more useful to look through  the list of advices (i know i know) to ponder what could be applied in the nearest  future  32 june 23 that is very good that i try to keep my english at a good level i dont think i  need these certificates right away because they expire but in a couple of years  when ill probably be moving this might be a good idea spent a day building some custom jenkins + gitea onpremise solution too bad this  is anias most interesting course and she is too tired to actually learn something  but i did i now know what is this mysterious `onpremise` thing and vaguely  understand how different pieces of coding infrastructure interrelate  33 june 24 enjoyed quite a lot of pragmatic programmer found a whole new security thing to be  new and interesting for me maybe we need some specialized service to handle logins  and passwords except for keytar some endtoend login solution  34 june 25 had rather a lot of organization experience with amin fought hard to win deep  enough tables not quite a pleasant experience had two sessions with nastya yanina she is tremendously good probably she is just  like any other interviewer but i forgot there are people who know their stuff it  is something inherently pleasant when you observe a person who knows his stuff i am still utter shit when it comes to interviewing you didnt prepare how dare  you i think it is the biggest source of your errors today always prepare when it  makes you seem so much more confident and knowledgeable dont let the stress of  minute things rule you it is very difficult to reject i have yet to reject two people and one of them is  a close aquaintance of mine obviously i feel bad but once again  you went to  dima out of utter despair even when you knew that he will be unable to do a thing  next time think twice just because a person is hardworking (and to me dima is not  the most pleasant person in the world because of his speech and attitude towards  anything except stem disciplines) you have no right to take him he needs to be  really interested (as gleb) and easily taught or really competent (as maria  karyaeva) it is not enough to be hardworking  35 june 26  36 june 27 started to read a book on pragmatic thinking and learning went through a third  part of it in a day had a large strategic session with amin the only positive part  managed to raise  my salary a bit but then oh my god we will have to do so much for these two  months im literally terrified ive never been more terrified in my life i  believe it is right to set up proper expectations from the start you cannot go  around and say things like `we can do this we can do that` youre going to answer  for it  37 june 28 had worked through a webpack pipeline i now care more and more about the  `big picture` how things work in the big world where load is big work is  distributed and stateoftheart frameworks are used to coordinate your work  38 june 29 had started to learn kubernetes its been long since i wanted to have a look on  what it is and why use it now i have a `need` to integrate it into our flow  39 june 30 going to spend my last day of the june working and learning kubernetes im very  interested and this should give me more ideas on how things scale in the real  world  40 july 1 kubernetes will be a really expensive experience if we take managed instances im  glad i put some effort into understanding why people need it but im freezing the  research for now did some react programming another day another fun experience every new  technology has a set of characteristical traits that inspire you to make different  engineering decisions take props\callbacks communication for instance in ts both  of these are typechecked and whenever you are in a component (and not trying to  break the system on purpose) you should not have contact with any global data  neat  41 july 2 unfortunately had produced nothing of value managed to have some rest though  42 july 3 i just want to leave a sufficient blank space for my findings when i find out (much  later) whether my decision to use react was a good one or a bad one future egor  just remember  you do not understand shit right now you tried your best and gave  just an educated guess at best if not a random guess  so please fill in lessons learned:   two weeks later we are doing the prototype and so far so good react structure    helps in isolating pieces of work and keeping it organized   15 month later still liking react a lot however the complexity was a bit    underestimated and you should be aware that you need to have a really good look    into a framework to understand its design and to work with it not fight against    it   2 months later and still liking react a lot had used the `react router` thing    to route pages easily i think the   25 months later and it seems like react is staying with us choosing web    development over electron development had its own drawbacks but i believe that    the ease of delivery beats our inability to make the site look good on safari    btw fuck safari   i therefore conclude the experiment with positive result updated my nvim to 05 dunno whether it became better in any way but im going to  try to have a look at treesitter and telescope and probably even move away from  coc do it smart okay have backups  43 july 4 ive spent the whole day messing with my configuration files and that was quite a  productive day i managed to make work: native lsp treesitter animated  statusline patched font and had a look at lua i also cleaned up my config got  rid of a bunch of irrelevant plugins / settings got an idea of how to customize  pieces ive assembled together in general i feel that was a time well spent (and  i also learnt to do nice little window previews)))))## the big change start of the onsite mdinc work with me as a cto  44 july 5 had my first day as acting cto some initial information interchange happened  people started brewing together but i just simply have no idea what to do rest after work does not bring relaxation not knowing what to do makes you fearful  of the coming day i believe you have to have some time alone alone no ania and  no hugging to death just some time to think  45 july 6 i need to set more explicit goals it goes more or less well with gleb giving him  explicit instructions works well but i need to do the same with ania otherwise  she gets frustrated as hell and it is unbearably unpleasant she disrupts the  workflow of the whole team putting your thougths on screen really helps you to clear your head it is as if  written thougths leave your head for good not having prettier irritates me as hell why is it so difficult to install  46 july 7 ive managed to set up a kubernetes cluster i did use a managed instance but i  still wrote all the configs for deployments fully understood what ive been doing  and managed to reach the end result with a combination of knowledge and  guidefollowing im so very glad it looks like ive surpassed stage 2 advanced  beginner in programming i still do a lot of copypaste coding but i seek to  find answers instead of solutions and blindly following that k8s guide without  understanding i wouldnt have guessed to use another `kubectl` image i wouldnt  have known the right way to connect to a port with a load balancing service you need to have a rest evening tomorrow you will wake up earlier and look at the  big picture but today let your mind be free use your recent notes tomorrow  really you could have saved yourself a lot of trouble if you just fucking read  what you wrote  47 july 8 i swear i am going to do it smart this day im going to have a plan in the  morning accounting for my mistakes for a couple of past days and im going to  follow it ania was right it is only three and most of the stuff ive done was before 1 pm maybe you should really read developer twitter) it seems so much fun solidified some dns concepts gained experience debugging kubectl resources i do  not understand yet why people keep saying k8s is dificult it is complex involves  many moving parts but for these days ive never yet experienced a problem that was  k8sspecific moreover k8s provides brilliant tools for cluster inspection so  navigating even nonk8sproblems just became easier now just waiting for a dns change to  propagateyodatlsletsencryptanno5jj8pp2972670955900203991###### now for a disappointing note okay it is absolutely clear im not able to work when constantly distracted even  when i dont feel irritation (even when i feel dutifully distracted) this forces  my main work to happen at nights and this is terrible for my health for my mental  state for everyone except for the job shortterm and even the job suffers  longterm im not sure what to do yet i think im just unsatisfied with the  amount of stuff i produce as a programmer i suffered so hard to be a good  programmer but all this goes to waste this is how my brain might be thinking i really need to work on my worklife balance who are you kidding even today you  left your attempts to make https work only because dns queries are cached and you  know you would just be unable to complete it today  48 july 9 a thing crossed my mind  how am i going to look if i will be seeking work and my  previous position would be `startup cto` an obvious `why you failed` and  `probably you are bad` readily jumps into consideration i might lie on my resume  downgrading my position like team lead or tech lead if you want to keep the  scale by immersing yourself into working environment you cut off all the other  opportunities for growth youve stopped reading youve stopped keyboard  exercising (however im pretty delighted with my results lately ive been doing  fewer mistakes and typos) how about a strict set of rules to help you first  work/personal tmux sessions ive stumbled across a youtube video that showcased an app to perform loadtesting  of your website now you thought it is going to be hard but it turns out it is  very easy to implement and interpret at some point it even may get into the ci  details aside is there anything else that could be done by easytouse tooling  that youve considered inappropriately heavy or outright impossible the part of learning when you recognize a practice that does not bring value  anymore is hard it is hard to reject something youve been doing for days but  youve already dropped using it right this unpleasantness when getting rid of  something is just absurd also ive noticed a tendency to take notes and thoughts lately rather than talking  about what ive done and learned that got me thinking  what is the goal of the  diary   shortterm when im writing allows to clear the head and solve shortterm    problems   longterm when im reading im probably not interested in logs that contain no    reflection information like `no progress rest day` is pretty noninformative    right i wonder whether i should keep these records as history now  49 july 10 read about mindmaps in `the pragmatic learning` i am quite impressed that might  ease the hardest stage of information processing  the review they offer the  representation of your data in a layered approach and you can freely choose how  deep (or in what direction) you want to move im starting to worry about whether i am a mindless cli fanatic just to think   ive just spent over an hour trying to find a tool that draws mindmaps in cli  and what is most frightening  i found one how about really trying to draw mind maps by hand i would lose the ability to  quickly store them but in the largest percentage of cases it is the act of  documenting that is more important then a documentation itself even my diary  entries that were supposed to be reread and learned from were read like once for a  hundred days so as another experiment lets really try to do paperbased  mindmaps once im back in the office finished `the pragmatic thinking` going to try a couple of new things: smart  goals mindmaps personal wiki  50 july 11 i think im going to stop reading books about learning blindly until i have a  chance to apply at least a fraction of what ive got from the older ones started taking walks  51 july 12 had a business meeting with people much smarter than i am  ori team i  overestimated myself and they greatly helped me in remembering what are the right  questions we are all here ultimately for the product and in striving for minor  achievements we really forget the big picture youve been automating the  deployment the whole week you should have been looking in another direction from  the beginning you still managed to figure out what job can be done by no one  except for you (within reason of times and effort) and complete it within reason of  time and effort but  1 youve been lucky because you didnt explicitly set out to do just that  2 youve demonstrating resulting you might just as well have achieved nothing     with k8s (and you still may be implicitly wrong because there is no 100% that     your setup is any good for resulting production setup) youve managed to strongly increase your understanding of the product within one  day that is just for you to remember  another lesson on not making big decisions  up front  52 july 13 maybe amin is not that bad at least i understand now that he does things he is  not a person that is easy to communicate with on the contrary  i have to make  tremendous effort to keep our communication fruitful but how he manages to find  people all these connections  they really help he needs me that is for sure  but the company also needs him  53 july 14 made an engineering decision to write a custom script that generates some code from  the other piece of code as the way to remove duplicating this second piece  manually tried my best to automate and isolate it but it is still a complication  not sure whether we got enough benefit from doing it but lets remember this day  when this system will first fail and i hope it is going to be a useful experience  the pragmatic programmer promises code generation being a good thing probably not  on such a scale though all im generating is knowledge duplication :))) time will  tell  54 july 15 experienced another meeting where i felt completely out of place in terms of  speaking skills i really need to develop those andrew ragimov gave me a link to a list of materials on the topic a good thing to  do a good thing to do as a smart goal and i continue to speak nonsense to andrew for no particular reason i compared  myself with dania it only underlined my subconscious wish to be better but had  also shown the fact that im not that focused on the product which is wrong  lesson learned: if it is an important communication always think before you write  some nonsense also lesson learned: learn to do interviews you did some antimarketing then you  disclosed more info to the candidate than it is required in general watch your  tongue and watch how the others do it you need to do mindmapping on your engineering diary the corpus of data becomes  much bigger than you can manage with your brain  55 july 16 had one more meeting with andrew and his team and im very positively primed for  what i can learn from them sergey is a team leader and he looks friendly i  didnt like valeriy that much but anyway who told me the world is a place filled  with cute people raspberry works on arm architecture might cause some gitlab runner problems you  should have researched this a little bit deeper before blindly spending your money  on it on the other hand you did it that day to release your emotions right so  no worries gained some insight into how to plan for releases you do a demo release so youre  sure that you can deploy and not encounter any critical errors in the last crunch  hour gained some insight into how security should be established in the project not  only these guys think about direct data leaking they even think about social  engineering when a particular notquitetechie megadoctor gets an uberpassword for  every patient and some malicious people crack him and gain access to all the  clinics another point of view: a main doctor of the clinic should not have access  to anything else but his clinic if he gets social engineereed and leaks his  hospital full of data that is on him but if he leaks all the other hospitals with  it it is definitely on us  56 july 17 explicitly trying to spend my weekend resting kept meditating though i dont  think it is worth breaking on weekends as this is a habit that enhances my common  mental capabilities instead of working might be a fun idea to train a neural network on these two diaries at some point  im no expert but i feel that several thousand lines of text should already  provide some value started producing mindmaps of my diary as the index of everything important i have  learned now i will need to come up with a way to store them felt that ive reached quite a fun experience using my working environment i mean  editor and all its features \ drawbacks etc im no longer sure i need to invest  heavily in its development unless problems present themselves or i will gain fun  from further configuration and customisation  57 july 18 spent another productive day with amin ive learned a lot about the product  again i hope that will continue but im rather worried about not doing anything i  like and this all of a sudden change in my workstyle this might be useful no  doubt but im not that sure i like it i like making solutions that work i  dont like producing metainformation about solutions asked for an advice from andrew he underlined several facts that were mentioned  earlier in my diary but started to have a deeper meaning only now he said that  im at at a very good position to learn blazingly fast since i have people to  learn from and people to teach he also said that i need to behave like on a  plane  first a mask for yourself and only then for the kids i think it is safe  to say that im important for the wellbeing of the project without me being even  slightly arrogant im amazed at how much mood can be altered with a simple point  of view from the side it costed andrew around 13 minutes and yet im sure i would  be unable to reach the same kind of state of mind using the same 13 minutes myself amin offered me some kind of a conference to pitch our startup on i know that the  single thought about presenting something in front of many people terrifies you af  but you will be able to prepare you will be able to train yourself and there is  no better deadline to do something than the external deadline  58 july 19 i noticed i still get stressed every time i communicate with people on questions i  dont like and dont know how to answer on but if i quit tickerwatching for a  second and have a look at how many of these interactions i have nowadays without  completely losing my mind i will notice that im making good progress in stress  resilience this day i communicated with masha who kept bugging me with business  questions with daniel who is smart enough to ask uncomfortable questions to an  employer and with amin who is no commentaries actually amin is not even that bad in terms of communicating i just realized it is  the great number of small things we need to hold in our heads that make it  stressful for me im not really into managing long knowledge documents im into  making something that works but i have to do a lot of paperwork (valuable  paperwork im increasing my understanding of the product and hopefully  understanding of the whole team) recalled i have my own fetishes to satiate and had a great evening of typing  practice  59 july 20 okay let me clarify amin is not that bad in terms of communication he tries but  he is absent like 99% of the time and he is really a bottleneck designers and  frontend engineers are on the edge of becoming idle because we dont have enough  product requirements im afraid a period of prolonged apathy and who knows depression may advance im  not sure how can i `first put a mask on myself` when i really dont have that much  of my responsibility to put on someone elses shoulders how im solving this  calling ania on meetings it is likely even about not having enough on my shoulders because when amin is  absent i feel im hopelessly disconnected from the process of development how im  solving this just living through the days and hoping we will understand stuff  better when 31st is over thats where i will code again i think  60 july 21 skipped one day didnt get when :((  61 july 22 today i allowed (well i could not protest anyway protesting is not my nature) guys  to play stardew valley at worktime it kind of seems that it did not damage  anyones productivity dima still made progress on the frontend we were able to  repair ci\cd with andrew ania made progress designing speech gleb made progress  with tests (btw im glad he becomes more autonomous that is very promising)  question: is it worth doing that every day (well it is a lot alike watching tv  series once in a day at worktime and ive allowed this for the past two weeks)  i guess really an effect of reloading the mind is more important than the raw time  spent at work  62 july 23 spent a productive day gave work to everyone had a rest and even programmed  (html) a little bit myself i wont say ive forgotten a lot but a certain  smallestlevel cache of my brain is already clean from programming and it is not  just about remembering these little css attributes and their domains this is  easily googleable  but certain patterns that youd use subconsciously which is a  major inconvenience as it is nonregenerable by direct actions you need to  practice and warm up your cache again as serezha once told: "one day not  performing you feel it yourself two days not performing your family feels that  three days not performing the audience feels it" people do overtime your team does overtime you should really attend to it until  it has got out of hand a little bit irritated in the end of the day because of the speed im doing  frontend at on the second thought please dont be youve got a complicated  product with a lot of complicated pipelines it is perfectly valid to expect that  the speed of imiplementing changes is going to decrease  63 july 24 spent a good part of the day writing react things learned about functional  components react hooks and practiced my frontend skills in general was pleased to  discover that the working environment ive setup for myself turned out to be quite  convenient and im navigating directories and files quite quickly took down several notes where i can improve my environment quality not just  installing dozens of plugins hoping they will be useful someday but real use cases  in my workflow  64 july 25 with me becoming a cto world has lost a programmer with a good potential i really  dont think that my place is that high anymore i dont like doing nothing for the  whole day ive considered rationally that im in fact doing quite a lot and  mentally it feels like im doing nothing not only for me but probably for the  people on your team as well dont plan to stay at mdinc at such a high position  probably you could request a demotion with an increased salary and stay working as  a programmer  65 july 26 had my first sprint planning i now think that the value of sprints lies not in  making sure everyone hass more or less equal amount of workeffort but rather in  making sure everyone on the team has equal picture of shortterm future helps to  avoid moments like ah i thought it is going to be very different from what you  just said and even more simple moments of wait what  66 july 27 if i offload a part of my responsibilities to ania (even though amin would be  against it) the life does really become much simpler i even have had some time  today writing some code and that moralized me quite a lot and made me closer to  my guys who write the code for me i should appreciate that have really been thinking with anton about making a neural network out of this that  would offer me insight into my thinking process should i repurpose myself into a  data scientist that would be an interesting part of my career  67 july 28 another day another lesson on not reinventing the wheel you tried to  overcomplicate a calendar in mdinc application and then you found an npm package  that encapsulates all the complexity of date management using it allowed me to  shrink my uglylooking prototype thrice and it is now easily understood because of  clear naming conventions  68 july 29 unfortunetaly skipped the day spent time playing terraria with gleb and then  spent an evening with ania well it is a matter of choosing priorities you  deprioritized your diary this day  69 july 30 had a frustrating experience of amin observing us through the cameras and  explicitly asking us why are we playing did not quite like the experience started  to actually worry whether we are going to manage everything that he wants i should  have explained that the release on 16th is not a final and an official one going to visit anias dacha again have to look funny and content :( do not actually know what i want to do these days on the one hand i have games   but they wont feel the same without guys on the other hand im pretty upset and  unsure if i will be willing to do vocal and meditational activities  70 july 31 no working experience played caves of qud for several hours but i rather suspect  it was just the escapism not the true will to play that particular game  71 august 1 another day spent playing still not sure if it benefitted me anyhow decided to dedicate one particular file to recipes to action  it would be the  extract of my knowledge when it will come to training the model (if it will)  anyway it might prove itself useful even if i wont get to train the model it  might just be worth rereading focusing on an activity allows you to accumulate the feeling that you are doing the  right thing and multitasking sometimes does quite the opposite## after neural  72 august 2 preparing another sprint planning a certain structure element is useful in every  team when you dont take it to extremes it feels much more confident to have  these opposed to just working and distributing tasks on an emerging basis spent some time battling vim but managed to win and produce a shortcut which would  send a sentence under cursor to the neural file im not sure that i spent less  than i managed to win back because of this speed up but the easier the action  itself the harder it is to drop it this way i hope it will be easier to  accumulate data in my neural file without forcing myself to do it every time  73 august 3 another day at work another day to remind myself that im really the lubricant  that catalyzes task solution processes not the task solver itself it is okay that  it feels as if i was not doing anything productive today in reality you helped  many people understand many things just a little better than it was in the  beginning of the day im not sure if i solved the task in an optimal way but i introduced i18n to the  application literally 20 lines of code for all the logic that was introduced by  heavyweight packages with minimal changes to our codebase itself im quite proud  that i was able to take a big picture look again and not dig into minute details  of trying to make one particular implementation work on the edge of signing off my responsibilities as a cto as always im not sure  whether it is a right or wrong decision but it makes sense i worry too much im  stressed and i have one important year at the university no matter how good it  sounds im not going to risk ruining both the company and the diploma in a  hopeless attempt to run both  74 august 4 found out that i was spending too much effort on trying to make our raspberry pi  run our pipelines at some point it was not even interesting i was just jamming  through countless similar looking guides and irrelevant github issues and i  realized that if i have a backup solution ready at hand there is just no sense in  doing something which is both not interesting and not useful the only thing i wish  i did better is realizing this earlier not spending an hour or so today on this  particular problem once again it feels like my presence empowers people allows them to believe that  we are really doing something gives them a vector of development but im not able  to immerse into manual work fully because of this effort i spend lubricating the  working processes i cant say i like it and at this point it feels right to be  just a teamlead of js developers instead of a cto  75 august 5 ah this shitty shitty network you wasted days of your engineering time only to  provide an https for a subdomain yet you are successful you suffered the  experience of rejection you rest assured in your infrastructure experience of  getting rid of things is a very useful kind of experience  76 august 6 managed to salvage some working hours set up a simpler version of our  infrastructure and contributed to the general quality of a codebase even had  spared several hours to play minecraft and it looks like it contributed to my  general productivity during the day who would have thought  prompt rest  contributing to productivity seen a video of theprimeagen on youtube it was showing a story of an experience of  accepting risk that a character was really afraid of taking the key message is not  to be afraid to take risk and perform actions of opportunity otherwise highly  unlikely however i still think i went a good way rejecting the cto position my  situation is in some way trickier than his hes got a pregnant wife but ive got  a diploma next year and a startup with a high risk of failure i will be just  unable to perform well at both and i bet the startup is not going to live long  enough anyway learned to accept diffs with `dv` in `g` window looks just gorgeous need to do  remaps and train a bit found out a simple act of washing your face with water and drinking a glass of the  very same substance can really sharpen your focus you are just so unskillful at  managing your body you should be ashamed spent some great time doing nginxkenobiyoda integration and for only 2 hours of  full concentration ive been able to construct that kind of architecture it  involved much thinking and many manual operations and im kind of proud i managed  to catch the flow and spent these two hours fully immersed i would not be able to  do the same in the office in a commanding position in the same amount of time key thought dont think solely in terms of time spent take the multiplier of your  physical and mental condition into account previously you thought  meh it would  be like [08  12] modifier so we can throw it out and focus solely on time  spent but in my latest experience it turns out to be rather [05  5] and when  you could spent like five times more time to accomplish the same task only because  you did not took your condition into account you are being foolish to discard such  a valuable piece of information  77 august 7 finished setting up `certbot + yoda + kenobi + palpatin` integration lessons  learned:  1 you befriended nginx + certbot via a 3rdparty script that increases setup     complexity and introduces a larger possibility of error you should have thought     hah no way no one else has my problem and searched for a better production     ready solution and it exists nginxdockercertbot image has a lot more usage     than this script i found and it literally removes this script complexity  2 i might really be tempted to get back into k8s because it was so much simpler to     setup in retrospect and much easier to use and with less 3rd party crutches     you might be willing to do the very same thing with nosql vs sql if only you     have time lets do a careful examination tomorrow shall we  78 august 8 finally laid out in my head the difference between the `declarative` and  `imperative` styles of defining things it is not that `declarative` tools are  overly smart that they understand what you need and do all the heavylifting they  do exactly that but to a lower extent  they are not omnipotent the domain of  things you can `declare` is quite limited the biggest difference between  `declarative` and `imperative` seems to be in style of structuring out your thought  as a programmer not the particular details of how the tool operates under the  hood one main difference could be: in declarative style your code defines the end  result and in imperative style your code defines the starting point and what to  do and the end result is kind of implicit  79 august 9 discovered this wonderful channel `fireshipio` that has lots of quality  information on javascript and since im going with javascript i think ill need  this stuff any application that can be written in javascript will eventually be written in  javascript im very glad that i started thinking in production ready ways i try to avoid  reinventing the wheel  well at least before i try to reinvent one im always  thinking first whether it could been done by someone else in the world way better  than me i also stopped taking things for granted and stopped being so easily  tricked into using new pieces of technology straight away trust but verify in  hpmor verifying your hypothesis is the first thing that comes to the mind of the  main hero in any weird situation at all times recalled some important concepts on which javascript is built jit event loop  dynamic gc use console for debugging really there exist many better ways to go than  `consolelog` maybe ill even buy something on `fireshipio` it looks like it is the channel  that dives into `why` when a vast multitude stops on `how` had a 4 hour long communication session with amin there is nothing more unpleasant  in the world than a person who really claims he knows what he is doing but in  reality it all turns out quite differently we just wasted three hours arguing on  an element in the interface on an important one but i feel the time was wasted  nonetheless how could it be done in a better way  80 august 10 had some more practice in dockercomposes certificates and nginx configs  81 august 11 if youll be looking someday for a valid nginx config be sure to check the  default run `certbot nginx` on default and remember nginx has a special command  for healthcheck of your config  82 august 12 refreshed my knowledge on web bundlers now i think i can explain it more clearly  to a person who knew nothing previously in short  it is just a way to transfer a  friendly js ecosystem to browser had a look at a wonderful video where `fireship` builds a todoapp in ten different  frameworks some of them are more popular some of them are optimized for web  components some of them are using or not using specific approaches like virtual  dom some are opinionated while other allow you to remain flexible but induce  decision fatigue the bottom line  they optimize your happiness as a developer in  different ways there is no need to jump straight at some framework and start  proselytizing it above all else just use whatever makes your life easier and look  at the key points that each technology introduces (decision fatigue \ opinionated  webcomponents minimalism and speed \ richness of expressions) just try the  most interesting ones sometime from the video it looked like i want to try svelte  and solid sometime i have to try out redis sometime just for fun i trust `fireship` and he made a  point that redis can be used as a primary database had a quick guide on deno  typescriptfirst trying to be browsercompatible js  runtime and nestjs  a koa alternative were using right now learn to look at  the size of things if they are adopted by a wide community you might have an  easier time with it but starting off with new things could really help driving the  human kind forward purchased an access to courses on fireshipio it was only 50 dollars and i made  amin pay it at this point i should probably be saying hah if only your salary  was 500 roubles higher it would pay off so essentially all you got is a raise of  salary by 500 roubles for half a year it feels more though i should be aware so  as not to have any emotional attachment to amin because of this but i seriously  dont think i would have bought something like this if the money were my own so in  a way thanks amin for taking part in my education process useeffect (3 ways) usecontext useref bottom line is  10 minutes of your time  properly invested could buy you so much understanding sometimes best code is no code at all over the next three months youll build an  app that uses backend as a service and this is going to be quite a new experience  for you you will try a managed yandex instance and probably youll have a look at  yandex serverless computations would be a great idea  83 august 13 just another day at work dived a bit deeper into react world watched a video  about redux and made a happy decision that we do not need it however remember  usecontext had a lesson with bryden it is amazing how low i pay for how much i gain he  literally forgets about payments grants me dozens of hours for free just for  watching him on his channel and he might be not so wrong because i dont see  myself leaving him anytime soon since ive developed such an emotional attachment notes on server side rendering   static  at build time but may become stale you need to rebuild scaling    difficult good for blogs and small sites   server side rendering  at request time   incremental  something in the middle request for example at most every x    seconds this ensures the data is stale for at most this specified time period  84 august 14 had some time moving to telescope it seems to be much more coherent and  generalpurpose and has a lot of hidden stuff fzf was good but the whole setup of  mine consisted of crutches only i think ill learn some lua along the way i need  to simply read the help file i think (read the friendly manual) had found the first path i should probably experimentally take for training my own  model now the only thing im lacking is raw data you know how to solve this my mind is completely blown by telescopenvim amazingness im positive i want to  sponsor that person that seems only fair for the sheer emotion i got today produced a document examining reasons to go for and against kuber going to share  this with my teammates  85 august 15 had some time watching how terraform works will try to setup this this week if i  have time had been discussing git history management with tolya and found out i really have  no position to advocate for google for `end of line blog oneflow` where one  practice is presented as a superior to a very complex but popular `gitflow` but  in the beginning is there really any problem to solve in the setup of our company  or we could just leave the things the way they are  86 august 16 started sponsoring open source wrote a personal email to an open source developer and received a wellmeant  feedback who knows i may really be able to give back to the open source community  someday had a series of absolutely expected but painful nonetheless web revelations like  safari argh i hate safari for just being different than google chrome for example  (and all the browsers based on it) same properties just behave differently the  internet is just a place that hadnt been thought through very well and if you  cant manage this and still make a good product well that is your problem as a  progammer  87 august 17 finished watching a tutorial on how terraform works and even was able to come up  with a sample solution to our ci\cd machine deployment i think terraform is a way  to go i even tweeted about learning terraform to only never see aws interface ever  again  88 august 18 worked on react application at work learned that designing a `cool` architecture  up front does hinder further development process remember it is better not to  make big decisions up front spent the whole evening working with terraform more on that tomorrow  89 august 19 had some quality time with ania youd ask how is that relevant to your engineering  experience well you were perfectly calm you did not worry about her being  disappointed and since pressure kills cognition i was able to perform better  today in the evening spent another day and evening working with terraform am quite happy with the  result having been working with it for only couple of days having spent somewhere  around 20 hours in total i was able to understand what problems does it solve  what approach does it take to solve them what limitations it has and how do i use  it in my current project to make life easier not complicated i just have to make  a couple more tests and ensure all pipelines are running smoothly i will be proud  to put this technology on my resume providers are very different :) right after thinking i learned enough i visited  terraform provider site and found out you could create groups of users with their  rights and branches in gitlab how wicked does this sound so you should remember  terraform in the end as a tool for graphical user interface haters i feel i was  born to use terraform maybe ill even write my own provider for terraform  someday a good idea would be to investigate other hashicorp tools just to find out how  people solve cloud problems maybe ill even start using nomad instead of  kubernetes why not it has a cool logo and claims to be much simpler than all the  existing solutions that is just about everything you need to jump at the  technology right noticed that you are already touching the boundaries of how do things work in real  production many decent web applications use lets encrypt and many decent sites  have troubles loading their fonts prior to actually showing them people have  problems just as you have problems no one in the world is allpowerful had thought that my choice of favourite editor has really cut me off of using  kotlin there is some reasoning behind an opinion that jetbrains will never fully  move kotlin out of intellijidea which is bulky does not feel convenient and takes  too much control away from you (well now that was my own humble opinion)  90 august 20 had been a sensible thing to do to rest for a couple of days because of being  overly loaded with work for the last couple of days im actually starting to worry i wont read this diary ever but for some reason  just the raw feeling of me having it does make me feel safer i might not need to  refer to that diary on a daily basis right i just need that feeling of being  sure of being able to recall  91 august 21 had been resting again had taken a vaccine had a good walk and had been reading  a book for a while  92 august 22 vaccine recovery day managed to slip in a piece of work though some db  management i start to accumulate basic knowledge on relational db i hope i will  be better prepared for the course that awaits me this autumn  93 august 23 spent a great deal of my day coding although i can feel that working closer to a  deadline feels increasingly less interesting and more stressful because you are no  longer solving an interesting engineering problem but rather just shifting words  by a single pixel and recoloring the buttons for the umpth time  94 august 24 a very distressing day at work produced little of value and my teammates also  produced little of value (speechkit pressure wordless amin fight with ania)  bottom line: tiredness is real and by the end of the day you are really wasting  hours instead of doing anything productive so if you ever wonder how to spend time more productively just dont run on  autopilot dont keep spending time just evaluate whether the thing you are doing  right now gives real value well now it is quite interesting how the common sense  of rationality intertwines with the messages from the pragmatic progammer they  said not to run on autopilot and this loosely corresponds to constantly evaluating  anything you are actually doing for usefulness not only locally to the task at  hand but whether you should stand up and go home or do something totally  different  95 august 25 produced an important thought a software issue implementation of a perfect  programmer should probably be o(n) of the time it requires a person to think about  the problem example  you have the text and you want to replace all the letters  e with a in it the rule is very simple it requires almost an instance to  think of the rule and so the good programmer (by knowing his tools and being able  to utilise them) should probably do that in under 12 minutes (i think i would have  gone with `sed` on linux cli and just pump the file into it) had a look at a k6 load testing tool for websites just a convenient wrapper for  running many http queries and simulating the user bottom line: if something  remotely routine or complex needs to be done there is probably a good tool for the  job in this open source world i am very engaged when it comes to learning some new fashionable frameworks or  tools it comes with a major problem though without really understanding and  feeling the problem prior to learning about the solution you will simply watch  through the introduction video with awe and forget it completely within a day you  are feeding yourself with false feeling of education and you learn very little in  general because you didnt learn to solve new problems youve just watched a  flashy marketing video or even worse developerfocused video (because it is  essentially the same marketing but it is much less obvious you are much more  likely to interpret these as if you are really learning something) however there is just an alternative point of view learning new technologies  before having encountered a serious problem you populate your inner catalogue of  solutions you start to see patterns in the world patterns of problems and how do  people generally solve these problems it is more likely that when you encounter  some specific problem you will discover a non overengineered solution that  utilizes your (or someone else) previous effort conclusion: ill continue looking through the tools that i find interesting  because that pumps me up with positive emotions but ill be very careful so as not  to waste time on these  96 august 26 had a long long meeting with a person masha had brought in to talk about our  infrastructure learned many things learned that you dont really give developers  access to prod machines learned that you start to bake in security from the start  by having a vpn instance and only allowing this to be the entry point in your  system (btw ci\cd will probably be having access to the cluster as it will be  inside the cluster) learned that im `perspective` and i think this person liked  me  97 august 27 had a clumsy day at work im increasingly feeling that im the master node that  only coordinates changes from different developers tests them so they dont fail  immediately and deploys them once or twice the month  98 august 28 the only disadvantage of this diary is that i cannot append any kind of information  except short text info to it probably it would be worth writing some service  hosting it somewhere on a raspberry pi (or actually make the thing serverless find  out about this interesting piece of technology)  99 august 29 did nothing for work just had my day with ania hope she appreciates it  100 august 30 here we go first 100 of my engineering days heres to another hundred started to take notes in my special small diary dedicated to my devops task for the  next couple of months let this be not only a training in devops but also a  training in the ways of rationality i intend to make the whole infrastructure  happen as quickly as i can which means i will have to employ my brain as well as  my time i will have to dedicate most fruitful parts of my day to this activity i  will have to ask for advice using all the channels i find necessary i will have  to ask for specific and paid advice of devops engineers like vania i will have to  ask at stack overflow i will understand what am i doing and what local and global  goals im trying to achieve at any given moment in time and im going to be oh so  proud of myself this is the challenge im completely up to at the edge of my  ability to complete it but the one im absolutely sure i have the necessary skills  and attitude my time is valuable this semester and ive never been so prepared to face this  difficulty of working fulltime + managing university if i manage to keep this up i  will earn quite a lot of money by the time i graduate and this is not only about  money i will be fricking awesome allrounder once i graduate and that is going to  happen while me being 22 it might even be worth thinking about staying at mdinc  101 august 31 released our application the last couple of days were rather mentallyawkward i  was spending much time on stuff that was like 5min and i hope it will improve  once i will be relieved of most organizational work and wont forget good  headphones probably the noise distraction was the major one during the last couple  of days im still committed to working smart on kubernetes too bad i was not able to come  any closer today dont pity yourself overly you could have a couple hours  progressing today into this activity released our application heres to some good days of relaxed work i hope things  start getting better im going to plan my milestones tomorrow i will have to  communicate with gleb and dima and im very glad gleb seems to become increasingly  more autonomous i need to make it clear to dima that he is required to communicate  with gleb and andrew curse this fake organizational structure imposed by masha and  amin still not sure how to go about ania though she seems really devastated  and the most peculiar thing about the situation is that i am convinced that she is  in an amazing position for her both the salary and working conditionwise  102 september 1 had my first day as a devops engineer kept progress in my yellow diary had a second extensive meeting with an invited expert frontend developer this  time learned a lot about what infrastructure decisions have to be made on frontend  for small applications bottom line  do not overcomplicate things there is most  certainly no need in microbackend applications maybe probably even no need in  microfrontend structure things are simpler than you would have thought and the  login problem is just a simple cookie with httponly set the only smart thing well  probably have to do is separate managing for what to load and when (fonts earlier  ml model later for instance) glad that ania was there as well these meetings  should probably give her the big picture of the programming world but im afraid  she is getting too little practice the application could really be monolithic your application does not have to brag  about using all the latest frameworks and solutions to overcomplicate the initial  program that solves the initial problem by taking into account future problems that  in reality will never manifest themselves good headphones are really important youve managed to scrape some time today  during which you were able to concentrate only because of noise isolation  103 september 2 had proceeded with my plan on devops engineering things went more or less  according to plan however i think im moving without a safety margin so i wont  be able to just leave someday for a couple of days you should plan your load in  advance or at least try doing so  104 september 3 no work done only rest  105 september 4 no work done only rest  106 september 5 no work done only rest i should really bring meditation back if not the voice practice  107 september 6 had advanced in my understanding of the devops design proceeded to terraform some  configuration  108 september 7 had quite a productive day including a meeting with serezha + nikita as well as a  separate one with vania wisdom extracted: a solid example from a professional  might solve most of your problems if you are a competent beginner copying will  help you to advance to the next stage quickly  to professional stage  where you  will be able to replicate with modifications or reject the previous design  altogether another wisdom: at your stage communicating with smart people is  strictly better than doing something on your own jump at this opportunity it  might be one of a lifetime opportunity to have a chat with so many different smart  people  109 september 8 rimworld and hpmor day gone  110 september 9 rimworld and hpmor day gone  111 september 10 rimworld and hpmor day gone read the conclusion on this day in personal diary  112 september 11 starting to catch up on university watched two lectures on db practiced a bit  rejoice there is only one pointless subject this semester i have the chance to be  quite proficient in everything except for encoding theory much math again  113 september 12 the day after vaccination head aches multiple relationships disappointments  again i guess what was for the past 1020 days was the natural `down` part of  `ups and downs` that an average person has for work # personal diary  1 april 22 [ work day exercise + ]played some `typingio` 2 lessons had 2 rounds on vocabcom repeated some stuff inmy head to solidify knowledge had a corpus strengthening set of exercises startedto recall some `vim` concepts feels difficult ive forgotten a lot read`pragmatic programmer` for 20 minutes and went to sleep  2 april 23 [ work day exercise + ]played some `typingio` 3 lessons had 20 minutes on vocabcom 2 rounds playedyoyo for 20 minutes started watching moshs react tutorial  3 april 24 [ work day exercise + ]meditated day 4 on focus will try to use the technique today separately from themeditation  finished watching moshs react tutorial (yay amazing that is a greatachievement)  committed some research notes to mdinc plans page played some `typingio` 3lessons watched 1 hour of evolutionary optimizations feeling frustratednevertheless have produced some conspects had 2 rounds on vocabularycom tried toplay yoyo but felt weird progress was not made i guess the string is just too wornoffor i didnt get enough sleep did some vim exercises things are looking betterslowly improving my exercises  4 april 25 [ rest day exercise + ]practiced a lot of `typingio` experienced unnaturally high typo rate i need toforce myself to slow down otherwise this typo rate wont allow me to progressfurtherpracticed some yoyo experienced unnaturally high failure rate i need to payattention to intricate details small changes of technique otherwise this failurerate wont allow me to progress furtherhad to drop further actions due to birthday activities i realize it will mostcertainly slow down the progress of the habit but these things happen once a yearand im yet closer to the understanding that i want my birthday to be my day ratherthan living up to someone elses expectationsunfortunately didnt have vim or vocab exercises  5 april 26 [ work day  exercise  ]had a driving lesson in the morning did some exercises on `typingio` feeling muchbetter than yesterday  58 percent of unproductive typing overhead after a quickwarmup did some vim plugin management removed old plugins tried colorschemerevisioned some brackets management contributed to exercises on easymotion +surrounding plugins some more `typingio` played with yoyo played not practiced found one lovely piece of music and just enjoyed half an hour of throwing this stuffaround guilty pleasure however in the end im learning how to use it in order toplay rightplayed some vocab but mostly to keep up the habit and not to develop a malady ofmissing it out  6 april 27 [ work day  exercise + ]played some `typingio` feeling much better in terms of typing power but concernedabout my vision eyes started aching after as much as two minutes of intenseconcentration on the screen recalling constant spine ache and possible maladies ofmy teeth im pretty sure i need to pay more attention to my healthhad a meditation session i really dont understand why they feel unimportant whenin fact they are one of the most influential activities of the day even if theeffect lasts only for half an hour it helps to bring unparalleled emotionalstability and the sense of purpose pleasantly surprised im no longer havingdifficulties sitting straight while meditating it does not distract me anymoredecided to have a sleep diary created entry 1 had a very good vocabulary sessionpracticed two new yoyo tricks had a bryden lesson i dont know whether consciouslyor not but he seems not to pick up as much mistakes from my side as he did in thepastspent the whole day trying to make docker homework work learned a lot though  7 april 28 [ work day exercise + ] finished docker homework feeling +moralized had a meditation session feeling better more relaxed yet the power of todays  session is noticeably less than of yesterday i guess it just comes with practice  it is still much much better than not doing it had some `typingio` practice feels as though im not progressing fast enough but  it is not the same as not progressing at all right you have time for this for  years and years to come :) watched networks lecture but rather bad prioritizing isnt it you just listen to  what you like had several rounds on vocabcom had some cool sub game experience had submitted one simple task to pcmsevolut completed one simple mdinc task spent 1 hour in dscontrol  8 april 29 [ work day exercise + ] had a driving lesson in the morning typingio had quite a small error rate today pretty proud of myself although for  some mysterious reasons im making quite a lot of mistakes while typing in this  diary)) probably its because im thinking at the same time on what to type about  and brain just gets overloaded visited a doctor and made a next appointment satisfied daily need for vocabcom had productive programming lecture had an hour of chatting with ania had watched two episodes of money heist its definitely going to my list had worked on mdinc task approximately 15 story points had a meditation before going to bed  9 april 30 [ work day exercise + ] messed with my vim docs tried some new fun zeroconfig plugin: rainbow brackets had a driving lesson maybe it is even good when you cannot figure something out   it reminds you to stay on the ground and estimate your achievements realistically had a presentation on productive programming they told me it would have been nice  to have a demo you asked the same question to yourself when preparing the  presentation but somehow left it unanswered listen to yourself whether something  seems inconsistent lizard brain time practiced yoyo intensely im closer to letter a but what troubles me is success  inconsistence i can perform many tricks but every one of them succeeds like 60%  of the time do i need to pay attention to details and use scientific approach to  try to see patterns probably but im so comfortable just randomly throwing it  around had some typingio consistency seems to improve i notice it both in the diary and  in the rate of errors in exercises themselves managed to keep 4% unproductive  keyboard presses for 3 lessons straight and then it even became 3 trained on vocabcom i should do this earlier in the morning or early day in the  evening the learning rate is already much lower read the pragmatic programmer on reversibility and orthogonality captainhook in  mdinc is a great example of an orthogonal module weve changed an entire ml model  without impacting the controller  10 may 1 [ rest day exercise + ] had typing practice in the morning results are naturally a bit worse than usual  since ive just woke up but they are already consistently substantially better  than with what ive started this exercise had a great time assembling lego iss halfway through went for a run starting to earn points for pe had 4 series of paper house with ania feels good even to rewatch it had some time on vocabio ania thinks it is a useless practice but i think she  does not fully understand what i do with it so keep it up youre a good boy  11 may 2 [ work day exercise + ] finished assembling iss looks gorgeous had some typing practice managed to keep unproductive metric lower than 7% this  time speed and consistency are also [subjectively] improving tried hiit 7 minute workout i think i can handle it there are a couple of  exercises i really struggle with but overall this is hard but 100% manageable had a really wonderful tinkoff workshoplecture with their teamlead feeling a  better understanding of di and obscurity concepts had a meditation session today didnt feel anything at all i think it was a  practical experience  as everything in this world meditation heavily depends on  your body state so you shouldnt expect it will grant the same amount of peace  every time you practice it nevertheless i continue with daily  "scanningupanddown" complementary exercises watched an hr lecture on how to prepare a resume and pass interviews gained some  insight finally had a parprog lecture had some great time on vocabcom learned a new cool word: `dregs` as in  `dregs of society` those remnants of tea leaves on the bottom of the cup read pragmatic programmer on tracer bullets spent an hour on last cool tinkoff homework about ktor and realised how bad i am  when programming using new concepts and foreign environment at least i have enough  experience to understand what should be improved and in what direction i should  move :)  12 may 3 [ work day exercise + ] read `thinking in bets` on why everything we decide on in this world is a bet  also  learn to live with failures they a) feel twice as hard as a win feels good  and b) most of the time happen even if we made our best judgement also  admit  that `hearing is believing` that you do not mostly validate the information you  heard or read somewhere to be true but rather believe it instantaneously and in  the very small number of cases you check it long afterwards admitting it is the  first step to fixing it finished watching `la casa de papel` with ania once more watched 4 series cleaned my keyboard and practiced `typingio` this time i managed to keep this key  metric under 4% during 45 lessons consistency does really come from regularity made a presentation about vim received good feedback from artem finished 10th kotlin homework produced roughly the same amount of boilerplate code  ive produced throughout my entire life  13 may 4 [ work day ] had a driving lesson in the morning despite constant mistakes im already much  much better and more confident today i felt +moralized had a run and one more run in the evening because one keeps forgetting his wallet  somewhere outside his pocket total: 12000 steps for the day had some `typingio` training still cant quite get below 3% but the typing speed  is slowly increasing at the time of writing it is 65 wpm on coding with all kinds  of weird characters had a lesson with bryden came to a sudden realization that i do not use the word  `make` in the sense of `make a mistake` `make progress` ive always said `do`  instead this needs to be addressed improved some vim exercises and settings in config had some vim exercises  14 may 5 [ work day exercise + ] visited a doctor made a next appointment have been practicing dscontrol for several hours practiced the yoyo was pleased with how smooth several simple tricks have become  especially man and his brother and finally getting closer to performing letter a  barrel rolls do not seem so difficult either a brilliant way to quickly replenish  your ability to concentrate on some cognitive topic practiced `typingio` experienced a high error rate because of subconscious wish  to type faster i need to explicitly slow myself down during the exercise error  rate above 5% is unacceptable if you dont want to stop where you already are fixed `easymotion` vs `anylinter` racial hatred  14 may 5 [ work day exercise + ] visited a doctor made a next appointment monday 830 am have been practicing auto school dscontrol for 4 hours practiced the yoyo was pleased with how smooth several simple tricks have become  especially man and his brother and finally getting closer to performing letter a  barrel rolls do not seem so difficult either a brilliant way to quickly replenish  your ability to concentrate on some cognitive topic practiced a lot of `typingio` experienced a high error rate because of  subconscious wish to type faster i need to explicitly slow myself down during the  exercise error rate above 5% is unacceptable if you dont want to stop where you  already are watched a parprog lecture on kinds of failures tried to do vocab did one round but caught myself on being unable to perform any  more intellectual actions  15 may 6 [ work day exercise + ] had a driving lesson in the morning had 7minute workout practiced some `typingio` however fingers were too tired from two previous  exercises added autoimport functionality to my vim setup visited dasha made some progress on tinkoff final project visited my granny spent 2 hours on vim configuration found out some new ways to speed up file  opening process and cleaned some old configuration found some new prospects of  improvement snippets and git diff derived one thought: i heavily suffer from vim  premature optimization please try to figure out the problem only once youve  encountered it your vim navigation should be pretty solid at this point training  the exercises is probably a better way to improve in vim read `thinking in bets` trained some vocab  16 may 7 [ work day dissatisfied exercise + ] had an unnaturally smooth driving lesson of course i still failed in multitude of  places but the overall agitation and intense alertness starts to fade away cheers  to passing the exam on the first try :) spent basically the whole day banging my head against the wall about corsrelated  problems and randomly cantankerous databases i think not much can be learned from  the case except for the fact that im randomly trying to achieve my goal with no  prior knowledge on databases and no prior knowledge on how to deploy anything  anywhere better academical preparedness would be much appreciated except for the  fact that they do not teach it at schools asked a question on stack overflow read `thinking in bets` practiced `typingio` for a bit again hellishly large amount of mistakes :( i  must concentrate on accuracy and precision rather than speed probably even out of  the scope of `typingio` as im typing this right now i dont want to make any  lightheaded mistakes because my fingers are faster than my brain  17 may 8 [ work day turned to be a rest day exercise + ] had some `typingio` in the morning trying to explicitly concentrate on accuracy  but still fingers are trying their best to run forward i need to understand that  not the speed should make me feel good but rather accuracy every time i do a  typing mistake i should be slightly embarrassed had a running session 3km subjectively feels that it is more and more difficult  with every run :( watched 4 series of `la casa de papel` finished watching season 2 the ending has  secured this series position in my heart as one of the most dramatic and emotional  series ive ever watched im gonna show it to tolya someday on a rainy day in  september had vocabulary sessions now i know how the parts of a doorframe are called had a great hour working with yandex cloud feeling amazed and +moralized with its  simplicity proceeding with the plan there are always times in life when  everything goes smooth for every time everything goes to hell recognize it and  feel grateful  18 may 9 [ work day exercise + ] had a layouting session in the morning with tolya good to feel im a bit useful to  him as well had a typing session tried my best not to rush and make few mistakes however im  not entirely sure im improving as fast as i used to during these last 20 days  maybe i should drop it and replace with something else already on the other side  it seems reasonable that to progress linearly further in almost any activity you  need nonlinearly growing efforts so ill keep it for a while had some good sub experience had some nice vocab time had made a lot of progress on cursach im pretty satisfied with how this turns  out i must continue working on it for 10 days and i have to think on what i can  highlight myself with maybe ci\cd process had a good time reading `thinking in bets` had to take a break because of having  troubles with concentration also i have to admit the language of the book is not  quite my level it blossoms with words taken from a vocabulary of an academically  educated person had meditation session ive caught it again a feeling of lowered agitation and  alertness that i think is quite beneficial in inducing proper working condition  ive never tried to rest after meditating yet probably ill be able to enjoy my  rest even more in a calm composed manner watched one parprog lecture on async consensus and replstatemachines figured out a way to follow advices from the pragmatic programmer once in a week  ill try to go through the list of advices read so far and try to estimate whether  i followed them in the past week or not because writing down core ideas from a  book is no longer sufficient in my opinion had a productive talk with ania and tried my best to be positively skeptical and  uncertainty embracing  19 may 10 [ maintenance day exercise + ] continued reading `thinking in bets` noted that tilt could happen even in the most  innocent situations as in typing practice once you start making many mistakes it  is 1) difficult to stop the process because it feels like you must `break even`  and 2) you start making even more mistakes because of that that does not help the  learning process in the long term had some typing practice it occurred to me that the most suitable time for typing  practice is right after you have an intensive workout because your muscles are  naturally tired rendering it impossible to type faster than the speed of thought  which allows for higher accuracy had a productive talk with ania tried to buy keyboard but they do not seem to ship  to russia wrote an email had a mirthful dozen of hours reinstalling ubuntu on the positive side i  succeeded in the end which fixed many of my problems with memory battery and last  but not least mdinc server queries had a meditation session completed 10 days on focus will try to keep practicing  these small interruptions to quickly flow upwardsdownwards through the body  sustaining flow focus improved vimconfigs after reinstalling ubuntu 20 had some vocab activity but rather not to break the chain than to learn something  sometimes the exercise turns out good and sometimes it seems like youve learned  nothing condition dependant i guess had some wonderful time messing around with my vim configs it is like my personal  private fortress where everything is so familiar and harmless :) learned to make  sessions which should save an impressive amount of time  20 may 11 [ rest day exercise + ] had some vim exercises in the morning watched several episodes of `friends` tv series rather enjoyed it probably it is  next goto for watching something with ania had a run fixed this weird mdinc problem with random disappearance of responses fixed this weird thing with function keys not working  21 may 12 [ work day exercise + ] had a run in the morning had some typing practice managed to apply some conscious effort to slow down and  avoid some mistakes but not during the whole exercise anyway its a big step  right recognition is followed by an action worked on mdinc for a couple of hours had watched a lecture on sharding had had a lesson with bryden had a couple of rounds on vocabcom had a 7minute workout had a meditation session which kind of helped me to drift away from tilt state  which occurred once i realized ill have troubles with pe classes had some yoyo practice ive lost some dexterity over the past few days but that  should not be an issue had great time getting to know letter a and tomorrow is  probably the day when ill just start growing its consistency had had a meeting with english team to setup what we will be talking about  tomorrow had half an hour of dscontrol  22 may 13 [ work day hidden 1 exercise  ] had a driving lesson in the morning had some yoyo practice i need to understand barrel rolls next time im going to  watch a whole video (maybe combos reveal why there is an additional level of  wrapping of the string around the finger) felt revolutions once and ufo once this  is not impossible after all had some typing practice im improving if im looking to improve right so there  is no much sense in just sitting through your daily exercise without paying  attention to what youre doing had a big amount of dscontrol on travelling through crossroads had an english language session enormously eating up on my time created a weird vim kata that should probably speed me up with the weird symbols  and exiting insert mode practiced it a whole lot today will be a day with a conscious lack of cardio physical exercise im going to  try yoga instead finished reading `thinking in bets` while i still will undoubtedly miss many  important details i think one specific thought from the book will persist for a  while this book reminded me to treat my own decisions with criticism to be aware  of many biases the most important being hindsight resulting motivated reasoning  and selfserving ok i realize that the single day is finite and even for the past 20 days sometimes  i had to make myself do useful things and when i failed to want it i felt  miserable and that was only making things worse so from now on and until the load  has subsided i declare vocabularycom typingio and yoyo optional activities  (which most probably means ill stop doing it for some time))))) made some progress on cursach well since im probably not going to work here its  not going to make a big difference right i would still be better off having no  heavy work when 4th course starts  23 may 14 [ work day terrible mood driving and physical education exercise + hidden 2 ] had a driving lesson in the morning everything seems to fall apart im completely  demoralized spent several hours in the shop purchased crosses and helped ania with bra then  we watched some friends tv series but it didnt feel like a quality time half a  day over and nothing good has happened got a possible rejection from a head of a pe department further driving my mood  down it will be very difficult to continue doing virtually anything at this point not a final rejection on pe ive emailed student office i hope they will be able  to allow me to enlist for strava above limit spent an enormous amount of time working on coursach and im proud to announce  that everything works in the cloud other things except for probably ssl are  going to be major but steady and separatable changes and my cursach has actually  given me some experience  24 may 15 [ work day exercise + hidden 3 ] watched a couple of one piece series a good mood for the day had some `typingio` practice im very disappointed in the last exercise  unproductive metric soared up to 10% this is so difficult to slow down and pay  attention to accuracy practiced some more vim movements idk why im not improving maybe i need to give  it more time or maybe the task ive made is quite difficult random punctuation  signs all over the keyboard completed one full evolut task in less than 7 hours thats big had signed an ssl sertificate for my tinkofflinkpreviewxyz had a great chat with ania had practiced some vim movements also installed vimium going to try it out  although you really need to type a letter then focus on the screen and type 2  characters this does not seem good in the case where you have to have multiple  clicks in quick succession  25 may 16 [ work day exercise  hidden 4 ] watched a one piece episode is it just me or it is becoming worse more  superficial i no longer feel this childish emotion of joy and immersion had a fight with ania idk maybe i could have dealt with this without spoiling  anyones day but i just couldnt help myself sometimes i rage and cannot hold it  how about meditating more extensively) had a rather productive session of vim stuff replaced denite with fzf benefits in  fuzzy finding much fewer lines of configuration and a really good look also fzf  integrates tightly with vimfugitive out of the box git flow will probably speed  up drastically with it (provided proper training) solved one simple task for evolut course i think the whole course should be called  "how to pass it having learned nothing about evolut algorithms" had some work done on cursach but fairly trivial some frontend validation helped tolya to write a good writing had some typing training had a look at alisas and denis vk pages for some unclear reason felt they live a  life better than i am and reach more than i did when i was their age perhaps it is  largely due to the social networks effect where a persons instagram is just  fabulous while his life is utter trash but it did provide an additional sorrow \   motivation punch i believe im going to be more productive tomorrow hidden goal day four especially proud since the last two days were especially  tempting since ive been writing several evolut tasks kinda stressful  26 may 17 [ work day pebble x ; flow x ; typing xxx ; hidden 5 exercise + ] read some pragmatic programmer in the morning and along my walking outside had some wonderful quality time made myself some black fried bread with onions and  a can of cocacola watched one one piece episode wrote some tests for tinkoff cursach wrote some code for mdinc read quite a lot of pragmatic programmer realized one piece of wisdom most of the time when i was daunted by some abstract  task at hand it was mainly due to panic mode again most of the time the solution  would have been a nobrainer and a shell oneliner :) going to have a meditation session and go to bed will try to go to bed around  2330 and wake up even earlier  27 may 18 [ rest day pebble  ; flow x ; typing  ; hidden 6 exercise  ] visited granny in the hospital prepared a way to squeeze some salary out of dania submitted a final work for kotlin tinkoff course flying colors had an interesting and a quite stressful time squeezing money out of dania and  amin it turned out to my favor in the end ill be working for 70k thats 80k  before vat otherwise spent the rest of the day with ania  28 may 19 [ work day pebble x ; flow x ; typing xxx ; hidden 7 exercise + ] had a meditation session in the morning makes sense to do it in the morning  right had a quite peculiar pebble exercise today it felt like forcewaves around the  pebble were flooding my vision i didnt smoke anything i swear :d got my place at strava light athletics have read an article from andy and dave explaining `tell dont ask` principle  its when you dont do: query object for state run some logic ask an object to  update its state accordingly what we just did was probably a responsibility of  called object not the caller instead we should just tell our object to do  something passing it some parameters this decreases coupling meaning that our  object knows less about its children than it knew before `tell dont ask` see law  of demeter practiced some dscontrol lessons feeling a bit more confident had some necessary paperwork for the university god bless its only once or twice  per year had a run 45 km researched a possibility to generate api types on the fly as per pragmatic  programmer  29 may 20 [  day pebble  ; flow  ; typing  ; hidden 8 exercise  ] submitted some blood samples for analysis gosh army is expensive had some great time playing elite (and setting it up) working on preparing the docs for submitting them tomorrow spent the rest of the day badly dont even recall how did it go  30 may 21 [ rest day pebble  ; flow  ; typing x ; hidden 9 exercise + ] submitted some shitty bureacratic paperwork had a 4km run had some good elite dangerous experience they finally released odyssey but i  still have to spent more than 3 hours of dedicated time just to get back to an area  where i could try all these things had an unpleasant experience at anyas talks about opinions never seem to go  smoothly and im always forced to take them im unable to recall any single time  ive openly rejected having a conversation with it succeeding today ania announced  that all the unlucky outcomes are my problem because she is literally the least  aggressive person in the world when she does it learned some dscontrol still quite scared though a little bit sad that all of my daily habits have gone to shit but at some point  its inevitable that there will be days when breaks happen right it is just  important to recognize those and continue as if nothing happened  31 may 22 [ work/rest day pebble  ; flow x ; typing xxx ; hidden 10 exercise + ] had a driving lesson in the morning probably its not that bad after all the only  thing i wish i did in a cleaner way is dropping the clutch pedal when you start had a chat with granny and dad dad reassured me that it will be fine me dropping  the clutch pedal i hope they were happy to hear me read `se at google` a lot had a 4something km run started to incorporate longer noheadspace meditations into my life i think it  will be pragmatic to start it with 1 minute or so this way i will feel less  initial distractions and pressure had a wonderful experience playing elite 300 jumps to go  32 may 23 [ work day pebble  ; flow  ; typing x ; hidden 11 exercise  ] had a wonderful time in the morning assembling the keyboard and riding  electrostuff worked for several hours on anias qt application ive forgotten a lot about c++  but i learned a lot about software engineering at the same time i will try to make  this project comply with several good practices as i see fit a sudden shaking experience with dania leaving mdinc a good reminder on why  nothing is eternal even when you have a colossal degree of confidence in something  happening (in this case my job) i was just unaware of a constant quarrel  underneath came to thinking it would be better to split the current state of this diary into  more eventdriven general narrative of my life and an engineering daybook  33 may 24 [ rest day pebble  ; flow x ; typing xxx ; hidden 12 exercise + ] had a driving lesson in the morning it was not so bad but it felt terrible i  get with my mind that situation is slowly improving but the instructor makes it  look like ive been doing this for my whole life and suddenly started making  errors he makes too many assumptions of what i know and what i can maybe other  people really have it this easy nevertheless it took me two hours to recover and  start functioning afterwards had planned a session with dashas instructor it is  nice to feel that you take actions in order to improve presently bad state of  things read `se at google` i think im starting to get the hang of the pebble exercise it allows for easy  detection of things that implicitly clutter your mind which in turn helps you  recognize them explicitly and express some serenity which grants you a clearer  mind even if temporarily why not put some effort into maintaining your mind  clean several years ago you were dreaming of touch typing on a keyboard with blank  keycaps and there you are at the moment touch typing on a keyboard with blank  keycaps recognize this had a run it feels like it becomes easier with every run to surpass 4km mark let  the next run be the 5km run also i need to ask dima how to run more effectively  34 may 25 [ ania day pebble  ; flow x ; typing  ; hidden 13 exercise  ] ran some granny errands in the morning progressed on anias legkov lab work learned to apply simplex method solved a  couple of tasks had some absolutely wonderful time playing elite dangerous the odyssey expansion  is just huge i liked it and it looks like it has quite a lot of content to keep  me entertained for a while i really need to quit driving this is shit  35 may 26 [  day pebble  ; flow  ; typing  ; hidden 14 exercise  ] played elite for 8 hours in total id say that for now ive satisfied my gameneed  for several weeks had a bryden lesson overall it feels like ive spent too much unstructured time (because of visiting  ania) and it started to backfire with an absence of motivation i really need some  alonetime in a mentally friendly environment not in an environment where im  afraid to go and pee because i might meet ones granddad  36 may 27 [ rest day pebble xx ; flow  ; typing xxx ; hidden 15 exercise + ] went to globus observed my mom driving she really pushes the gas pedal to the  floor and then drops the clutch pedal i will try doing that next time surely the  car raving a bit is better than me stopping with a dead engine right meditation with a stone revealed i have literally nothing on my mind today a good  possibility to fill a day with a quality rest had some typing exercises again i can confirm i tried to type faster than my rate  of learning would allow me although i felt that this `faster than i can` was  significantly faster than earlier `faster than i can` so keep going keep  reminding yourself that you need to slow down and some time later you will  probably need to stop because you dont need to type any faster than 100120 wpm  although i can tell that this point in time is faaar enough so youd have to train  some more had a great run 6km im getting closer and closer to completing anias 10km  marathon im motivated to do this within several months had a wonderful evening reading books  37 may 28 [ work day pebble  ; flow  ; typing xx ; hidden 16 exercise + ] had an exceptionally weird experience of talking to amin ive been literally  offered a     position of a cto in a startup that literally has money is this being at the right  place in the right time is that this kind of luck that comes once in a lifetime meditated had an interesting experience of having a panic attack and then  managing my breath in a way so that this panic attack vanished felt a bit like  paul atreides read some books i am now acting cto for 2 weeks just ridiculous again not slowing down enough when typing that will lead me to errors i just  fail to precommit to it every time i start typing im just going to do it once  more and see if it has any effect upd: ok it does work you just have to remind  yourself every time you open a typing window either typingio or eternal  38 may 29 [ work day pebble x ; flow x ; typing xx ; hidden 17/0 exercise  ] had a driving lesson today im a bit raging on my instructor atm  he keeps  behaving like i should know everything when it is obvious that if i didnt do a  particular thing before it is foolish to expect me to do it perfectly for the first  time i keep making many mistakes that is obvious but i also observe steady  progress i finally figured out how to solve my engine start problem i feel less  stressed on the road surrounded by cars etc stupid border warrior face hate you differentiated between two kinds of hidden goals had some work done on anias simplex method but i seriously failed to plan my work  from the top view and ended up spending two hours inventing the bicycle at least i  recognized it  39 may 30 [ work day pebble x ; flow  ; typing xx ; hidden 18/1 exercise + ] programmed my day through when i thought of going to relax somewhere i caught  myself that i wanted to sit there and continue well then autoachieved typing  training through coding had a run tried to go for 160 bpm reportedly thats a minimal heartbeat rate you  need to develop during an exercise in order for it to have maximal (if any) effect had discovered a nice little plugin that allows me to create simple ascii block  charts ive been latently thinking about a tool such as this for quite a long time  now had a lot of fun with it  40 may 31 [ misc day pebble x ; flow x ; typing x ; hidden 19/2 exercise  ] had a lesson with a new instructor this morning i was rather terrible but i liked  him a lot learned a lot of useful information i bet this is going to be very  productive and it is rather cheap as well helped ania to complete one university assignment as it often is with ania  lingered for a couple hours longer than intended going to have my first meeting as an acting cto rn also got some great news on the  office feeling +moralized need to finish my university shit though i forgot there are books in the world that are not technical todays hero is  `anancy boys` it feels so weird to return to a life of your own after living  someone elses life the pebble told me one piece is a good experience still it just turns out you need  to give it several weeks (56 would be enough) and that gives you enough context  and enough time to sink in the next time would be in a couple of months :) i guess it is time to start encorporating my flowing and static attention that i  learned from flow and pebble exercises into my daily life i already try to do that  while imagining this golden ball of light sinking into a specific object and i  also need to start doing the kind of static focus need to come up with a  visualization technique for this as well  41 june 1 [ work day pebble x ; flow  ; typing xx ; hidden 20/0 exercise + ] had a run decided to express in this diary only entries concerned with feelings and  experiences there is no point in duplicating this kind of information with  engineeringdaybook it becomes increasingly probable that i will take the role of the cto in mdinc at  least for the duration of the summer this is both terrifying and curious but  curious more so im grateful for this probable experience this is probably the  first major `be at the right place at the right time` event in my life coupled  with a strong influence from ania in short  i did almost nothing to get this  role it sort of just flew into my hands well see how this turns out it is absolutely pointless to have a pebble exercise closer to the evening you are  tired and nothing comes to your mind not because you were able to concentrate but  because nothing else today will  42 june 2 [  day pebble  ; flow  ; typing  ; hidden 21/1 exercise  ] suspending all educational activities in favor of passing several examinations and  anias lab assignments had a driving lesson it was pretty smooth but this guy still told me i suck at  maneuvering i do i believe i do  but he should sometimes let a word of  admiration slip away he does not had a regular bryden lesson had a long meeting where i was finally appointed (though no paper contract yet) to  the position of the cto not acting just cto  43 june 3 [ work day pebble xx ; flow  ; typing  ; hidden 22/2 exercise  ] had a great meeting with gleb programmed through the rest  44 june 4 [ work day pebble  ; flow  ; typing  ; hidden 23/3 exercise + ] another day another conflict my relationships are hinged on my policies at work  i am totally disoriented and unsure i appreciate anias readiness to help to  resolve everything though she can be cantankerous but willing to help even more  i think it is still experience i will value later on no matter what happens finished reading `anansi boys` it was a much needed break from a life that is my  own it was a gentle reminder that the only help you can expect from the world is  the help hidden inside of you this second you has already surfaced during the  last couple of years come to terms with him okay tried timewarrior utility going to test it over the next several days had a run  45 june 5 [ work day pebble x ; flow x ; typing xx ; hidden 24/4 exercise + ] had a run had a moderately successful driving lesson after i stopped stopping so much  everything became much easier both mentally and physically i stopped making so  many mistakes started to maneuver faster maybe i do not need yuri as extensively  as i expected i am going to take at least several classes with him though it is  quite therapeutic and he provides many pieces of knowledge my current one does not finished typingio even passed some of the lessons twice ill keep training with  words and with characters in my etern exercise "you say it is a crutch we tricked stone into thinking by using electricity  thats a crutch :)" it will sound silly today i forced myself to play computer games i reasoned   switch is standing by my side for a week and i havent even touched it didnt feel  right i picked it up played for a while it even felt okay but im sure it  would have brought me more satisfaction to mess with something i had more fire at  that moment like reading a book on se or messing with vim config or trying to  pick a perfect color for `timew day` chart dont do this again do everything if  and only if you have intense desire do to so (or there is a deadline haha)  46 june 6 [ work day pebble  ; flow xxx ; typing xx ; hidden 25/5 exercise  ] had a rather productive day spent most of my time on university and helping ania was proud of one simple thing  i was able to fight off a weird state of apathy and  agitation with a simple 1 minute flow meditation the result is tremendous it was  right at the beginning of the day and i believe the day would have gone rather a  different direction had i not tried doing this exercise  47 june 7 [ work day pebble  ; flow x ; typing xx ; hidden 26/6 exercise  ] you absolutely need working conditions in the evening that was tremendously  stupid working in the same room with a sleeping person on a squeaky floor on a  shaky chair with the lights off concentration just vanishes no reason i made  small progress that evening nevertheless made certain progress on legkov  48 june 8 [ work day pebble  ; flow x ; typing xx ; hidden 27/7 exercise  ] three days in a row without an exercise thats bad i have much less control over  my life when im at anias place today when im at my `corner office` id say my mood in the evening is better ive  finished more and the floor is finally solid instead of playing the violin really looking forward to be able to operate in one working context i hate having  to remember everything i have to do it produces stress that could have been easily  avoided have these things followed one another in natural order and yet they  happen simultaneously  49 june 9 [ work day pebble  ; flow xx ; typing xx ; hidden 28/8 exercise + ] had a run had an interview where i had to reject a person next time i may as well try doing  this face to face andrew flamed a bit on me to gleb in private it is weird to be considered a jerk  but at least i tried to tell him where he could improve and be honest in general  50 june 10 [ work day pebble  ; flow  ; typing xx ; hidden 29/9 exercise  ] having so much on my plate in the process of managing many mdinc stuff managed to help ania with her uni and have a driving lesson i use clutch properly  now  51 june 11 [ work day pebble  ; flow x ; typing xx ; hidden 30/0 exercise + ] having so much on my plate still but managed to have a run many educational things happening  52 june 12 [ work day pebble x ; flow  ; typing xx ; hidden 31/1 ] another part of activities that belonged to this area moved to some other specific  place  timewarrior now has a full info on runs for example this area remains to  hold abstract thoughts like this: youve dropped out of pebble exercise judging  by the last 7 days this aint good but have a coin for just noticing and  accepting it busy  when you didnt look up your investment status for a week  53 june 13 [ work day pebble  ; flow  ; typing xx ; hidden 32/2 ] busy  54 june 14 [ work day pebble  ; flow xx ; typing xx ; hidden 33/3 ] had an extensive meditation session trying to fight off an extremely agitated state  of mind tried sports flow exercise doing manual work  still very little  progress i hope though that every time i try it i get a higher chance of  succeeding  55 june 15 [ work day pebble  ; flow  ; typing  ; hidden 34/4 ] busy helped ania prepared for distr exam no time to minor self improvement  56 june 16 [ work day pebble  ; flow  ; typing  ; hidden 35/5 ] busy helped ania prepared for distr exam no time to minor self improvement  57 june 17 [ work day pebble  ; flow  ; typing  ; hidden 36/6 ] allowed myself to chill for a day completed the distributed exam in the morning  watched a couple episodes of third season of la casa de papel so far cannot say  that it is worse in any way ill try to watch the whole thing i suppose collected a batch of merch from tinkoff spring thing it wasnt for nothing in the  end i got quite a cool pullover (tolstovka really not sure what to call it im  quite sleepy) enjoyed my day still had a lot of mdinc things in it though anyway cant say i  dislike it this cto thing is going to be a huge experience enjoyed having enough time to just sit in the end of the day and be able to fill  many of my diaries having my thoughts in order  58 june 18 [ work day pebble  ; flow x ; typing xx ; hidden 37/7 ] had some very long hours into mdinc my life gets really different  59 june 19 [ work day pebble  ; flow x ; typing xx ; hidden 38/8 ] finished off another university enemy mdinc mdinc mdinc but not really put my day into watching paper house season 4  these are as exciting as the first two the whole gandhia thing was just like the  scene with a machinegun in the end of the first season very dramatic and  shivering  60 june 20 [ work day flow  ; typing  ; hidden 39/0 ] i think im going to remove the pebble exercise for a while at least while im  more interested in flow exercises they seem to give me more energy and  concentration didnt quite feel the same with the pebble exercise yet had written a cursach for ania im extremely demotivated about helping her and  visiting her i just do so many simple timeconsuming things for her and she  really got used to moving responsibilities to me right in the last moment im very  tired of this  61 june 21 [ flow x ; typing xx ; hidden 40/1 ] felt it was a time to remove one more thing that does not give any real value  the  status of the day otherwise id say i managed this day poorly but this is fun  admitting you made  this day poor and not this day being inherently poor gives room for improvement  62 june 22 [ flow x ; typing xx ; hidden 41/2 ] had a marvellous time in the river it is +3x celcius in the street and the river  is so warm many previous summers were quite a poor experience in terms of  `summerishness` this one already fights back  63 june 23 [ flow  ; typing  ; hidden 42/3 ] had been so busy with anias uni activities that havent found time for doing my  small excercises again although ive been on the river three times today i think  it kind of offsets lack of doing other simple things had a bryden lesson  64 june 24 [ flow  ; typing  ; hidden 43/4 ] it is so easy to keep hidden goal ticking when such a heatwave comes basically lived in the river that is so good to feel the summer is not wasted i  remember sorrow after the first year when i spent my whole summer at yandex and  never had a chance to have a good swim good god it is +40 and the river is like  your common shower water  65 june 25 [ flow  ; typing x ; hidden 44/5 ] found out i still enjoy doing things that are only remotely connected with my job  specialty i waged a war with amin on how deep our tables should be and i seem to  have won seven centimeters per table  66 june 26 [ flow  ; typing x ; hidden 46/0 ] turns out meditation can be unsettling probably because ive forced myself to do  it but anyway i think i feel a bit more agitated after the meditation than ive  felt before because i felt im wasting time and that brought me into a loop of  resonating bad feedback lesson learned: do not force if agitated to do something  then go and do this something  67 june 27 [ flow  ; typing x ; hidden 47/0 ] had a big session with amin i had to learn how to reject i cannot blindly go and  say `we will do this we will do that` however the whole experience is very  unsettling i have many responsibilities apart from technical and that disturbs  me  i dont like to make people feel bad and somehow this `level system` is going  to offend somebody  68 june 28 [ flow  ; typing x ; hidden 49/2 ] my first day almost fully in mdinc feeling work but feeling much more useful work  than that in yandex at least im learning at a good rate and i emphasize deeply  inside of me that this whole thing is a big learning project for me  69 june 29 [ flow  ; typing x ; hidden 50/3 ] had quite a busy day with ania an intensive running day three runs three  kilometers each within a day i didnt even cheat and use a bike im quite proud  of myself for being able to do that for not being a complete stick with a head on  top  70 june 30 [ flow  ; typing xx ; hidden 51/4 ] noticed a particularly interesting thing there are manager responsibilities i now  have that i fulfill rather poorly like remembering about potential illnessess and  dealing with vacations that kind of thing but my statement is  that is not  because i cannot manage these things it is because i innately dont want to my  brain just dismisses it as an activity that can be ignored and goes by happily  thinking about k8s and stuff the shit with not doing flow exercises ends today im very disappointed with  myself and i tend to relearn to do these along with regular meditations that i  also forget to do it is disastrous egor keep it together please feeling much better after having written all of this it is like my life is under  control elusive and dangerous feeling but while it lasts why not harness it  72 july 1 [ flow  ; typing xx ; hidden 52/5 ] my life looks like a bootcamp no furniture in the office constant delays we  will have a working environment at anias place this is going to be fun another day gone another day without flows even after i preagreed to revive these  to myself shit working from home is so difficult for me i want an office so  badly im completely unable to differentiate between work and life  73 july 2 [ flow  ; typing  ; hidden 53/6 ] unfortunately im starting to slip into the `unwillingtowork` phase or is it  just at anias place ive spent 5 days already and my working condition is  shattered so hard im going to have hard time recovering visited the office today we now have so many tech monitors laptops  peripherals ive got a wonderful monitor that is so wide i cannot see its edges  when im looking at the center the good thing  anias exams are about to end ill finally be free remember not  to agree when she asks to write her diploma  74 july 3 [ flow  ; typing  ; hidden 54/7 ] i had a day that partially restored my will to work and be interested in the world  neovim 05 has been released id like to tinker with lua configs go through my  setup and remove all the unnecessary junk hey hey maybe i will even be able to move to native lsp  75 july 4 [ flow  ; typing  ; hidden 55/8 ] this is going to be a good day ive got many nice plans prepared the weather  seems beautiful and not even washing the bathtub or coming to ania in the evening  to clean is going to make me disappointed and this was a good day indeed ive done so much neovimming  76 july 5 [ flow  ; typing  ; hidden 56/9 ] working is hard working in a startup environment is even harder i dont know what  am i doing and i am very afraid i never really appreciated having a set of  instructions now i really understand that i need some alonetime every day to kind of structure  everything in my head  77 july 6 [ flow  ; typing  ; hidden 57/10 ] no entries  78 july 7 [ flow  ; typing  ; hidden 58/11 ] dropped out of planning having so much on my plate my worklife balance is  completely shattered ive slept for two hours only please pay attention please remember your daily condition is much worse when you havent slept well  enough ive slept for three hours today and my fingers are having a hard time  typing words are mixing in my head and i cannot `force` mind clarity okay i  realize you do not regret having spent that night onto k8s but events could have  gone differently well if you went to sleep then not sure though your day is  destroyed but at least the morale of your team and your own is quite high were  starting to establish quite an infrastructure  79 july 8 [ flow  ; typing  ; hidden 59/12 ] i literally worked all day ive been working with people at work and then ive  been solving https issue on a k8s cluster in the evening productivity aside it  took more than 14 hours in total are you completely sure you want to continue this  way why are you doing this you just feel irritation because of not being able to  complete something is this feeling really so intense that you forget to sleep  (checked) eat (checked) take walks (checked) drink (checked) it seems  so  80 july 9 [ flow  ; typing  ; hidden 60/0 ] this is difficult for ania now dont leave her you are exposing her to the exact  same experience as you had the previous summer text her care i solemnly swear to not pay any attention to mdinc on this weekend except for ideas  that need to be taken down or my talk with ania that might contain work references  by doing that im hoping to start restoring my worklife balance and im going to  continue this process next week analyze why you get frustrated at work and act  accordingly to prevent such frustrations  write her: you cant let this happen to her the thing that happened to you last  summer  81 july 10 [ flow  ; typing  ; hidden 61/1 ] visited dacha for some reason i feel no more magic everything is so  uncomfortable i have no place of my own im constantly distracted and one  particular human larvae does not make things better will try to make a fire in the evening i can also try swimming went swimming ok i realized that in order to regain composure and be content with life again  you have to make conscious effort it is hard but it is a necessary requirement  it cannot get better without some conscious effort or at least it would require an  order of magnitude more time and even then it is not guaranteed implemented a megabrain idea  `recall` script that allows me to recall arbitrary  days from my experience not quite sure if it is going to be helpful enough but an  idea looks fun and again ive encountered studies on benefits of meditation this time the person  whose books i quite like claimed that meditation has longlasting effect it  develops the abilitity to sustain focus which is always with you and helps you in  your daily activities  82 july 11 [ flow  ; typing  ; hidden 62/0 ] now on the second day at dacha i was able to feel this magic again ive done a  number of things for my quality time took a swim made a campfire prepared some  onion sandwiches took a session of communication with nature it felt so unusual i sat to meditate  in the middle of the forest with all the birds singing around at the exit the  forest had given me a fine feather with ornament i took it the forest no longer  needed it im very glad i took the walk i dont even have words to describe it  because the feeling was purely subconscious took some photos though  83 july 12 [ flow x ; typing  ; hidden 63/0 ] had a meeting with andrew and nikita our mdinc consultants ive previously  thought they have only a surfacelevel effect and really do nothing but theyve  been helping with major business level decisions all along the same thing with  nastya you just underestimated them amin is as helpless as you are he needs to  be worked with not to be interpreted as last instance authority  84 july 13 [ flow x ; typing  ; hidden 64/1 ] visited anias dacha had a good time in general came to a conclusion that i  really need to spend more time with her on a more general note this is just  ridiculous to expect all the good things that come from a relationship without  seriously investing in it communicating you relax and develop get motivated do  not forget that you really need to supply the same for the partner  85 july 14 [ meditate x ; typing  ; hidden 65/0 ] thats it im starting meditations again if i keep trying im gonna make it at  some point benefits seem to valuable to just keep not allocating time for it  please believe it is important i officially sign ulysses contract on doing meditation once per day for the next  month  86 july 15 [ meditate x ; hidden 66/1 ] how about just stating openly that youll need to meditate openly this might ease  the unwillingness and uneasiness to do that at anias place found out i might just as well have covid what can be learned even things that  you think wont reach you do reach you in the end decided to deprioritize typing speed for a while it is inconvenient to do this at  work and im not taking my keyboard every time with me now  87 july 16 [ meditate x ; hidden 67/2 ] visited anias dacha today water is absolutely amazing the best temperature for  the whole summer this summer definitely turns out to have all summerlike  qualities  88 july 17 [ meditate x ; hidden 68/3 ] it is probably better to do meditation in the beginning of the day it has a  cumulative effect anyway (appealing to authoritative people here) but im missing  out on momentary effect of being additionally calm and concentrated for the next  half\whole hour after the meditation did meditation in the beginning of the day im going to give another ulysses  contract about taking this time early in the day unfortunately it would mean  before going to work on a regular day meh im no fan of doing many things in the  morning killed 30 mosquitoes in a day (but really the value of this line is that i did  not i just went around thinking that ive killed 30 mosquitoes and by the end of  the day i truly believed this thing myself the truth is probably around 15  although i did not count) i tend to reflect on the day for much longer and produce bigger diary entries when  im on the weekend coincidence dont think so)  89 july 18 [ meditate s ; hidden 69/4 ] had a tough day with several minor fights it looks like i have become easily  irritable and cantankerous and this does not correlate at all with me spending the  weekend at rest this should have probably reduced my stress levels but did not i  feel devastated demotivated and unwilling to go to work tomorrow when this happens just go and do something else dont allow your negative mindset  override your rational behaviour just leave youd do more harm than good anyway skipped meditation because of it felt unbearably unfit for any kind of conscious  thinking and went to sleep within minutes of lying in bed  90 july 19 [ meditate x ; hidden 71/0 ] the day went productive im trying to not do anything workrelated at home (which  is just a matter of not doing) and not feeling guilty about this (which is way  harder) im not sure whether trying to rest this weekend helped but i didnt feel this  explicitly probably because this rest was spoiled with the place i took rest in i  wonder whether i dont like anias dacha only because i keep repeating this to  myself improved my personal wiki set up clear goals on voice and meditation training i  just need to think of better ways to notice them every day for now im just  going to go through the set of pages every day  91 july 20 [ meditate x ; hidden 70/5 ] meditated in the morning and did vocal practice in the morning had another day at work im getting more and more stress out of communication with  amin but im also starting to be used to it getting increased stress resilience  out of meditation and also my focusing abilities are improving  92 july 21 [ meditate x ; hidden 71/6 ] experiencing evergrowing frustration with amin and the communications i have to  take in order to maintain clear mind and clear goals for everyone on the team notice the pendulum one day you are +moralized the other you are devastated it is difficult with ania our moods dont always match and she does not seem to  understand my frustration maybe she tries to help me this way i shouldnt shoo  her away she tries to be kind and funny do keep that in mind she is different  she tries but in a different way than you do  93 july 22 [ meditate x ; hidden 72/7 ] i started to notice a disastrous tendency im simply unwilling to get up in the  morning simply unwilling to do these vocal exercises unwilling to meditate my  mind is too apathetic it is not just about allocating time ive allocated it  and im just sitting right there with a phone and not willing to press  `start meditation` button question: is it useful to force myself into these  activities when im acutely depressed and then an unexpected thing happened i knew previously that one had to apply  conscious effort in order to leave frustrated state of mind but ive never done  this so quickly and effectively i achieved this by persuading myself that im  powerful strong calm and relaxed by repeating this at the slow pace and by  smiling looking upwards remembering there are good things waiting for me at work  people anyway please be aware that you can choose your mood at any given point in  time and youre not bound to behave in any way choose your mood and also be prepared for change be ready for interruptions for they will occur and you thought a diary is useless it has been a great help today in a  conversation with ania and it seems that ive managed to raise her spirits i  succeed in it rarely but today im proud to say that ive done it not with  mindless hugging but rather with motivating speech and who knows probably it is  going to be a remedy some day i just need to apply the same amount of attention  and effort  94 july 23 [ meditate x ; hidden 73/8 ] meditated at work our office does look like billions office indeed had a fine conversation with a `hairurg` nikita who is a local barber and who  claimed to have a first degree in theater directing and my life finally turned  radical  ive purchased a hair wax my schoolmates were doing this back in 7th  grade but only now i feel that i can do this without looking like a little  chihuahua  95 july 24 [ meditate x ; hidden 36/0 ] spent another couple of hours messing with configs tried to address problems i  already had instead of just installing a myriad of new plugins) thats a progress a disastrous thing happened i almost broke my hidden goal i think im going to  drop the counter by half for trying such a blatant and barbarous act  96 july 25 [ meditate x ; hidden 37/0 ] spent first couple hours of the day running around the block and collecting anias  commodities life maintenance :) im in the process of writing this when ania is on the edge of leaving the company  at some point this should have happened her roughness and cantankeroussness  combined with amins chsv almost guaranteed it i never thought it would be so soon  though i should not forget that unexpected things in life happen quite rarely this was  rather a commonsized conflict than a grave danger for ania but as i said  earlier i have no doubts it is going to happen anyway just a bit later i wonder how that is going to feel tomorrow to drive after such a long break my  last drive was more than a month ago of course im afraid that is only  reasonable i just need to think of a way to communicate that to my instructor and again youve left the meditation to the end of the day well another proof  that if you dont find the time in the morning you are not going to find the time  during the day even if youve been alone for the whole day  97 july 26 [ meditate  ; hidden 38/1 ] and today you really managed to do quite a lot at work and you had a driving  lesson that went relatively well and youve spent a quality evening with ania  playing stardew valley and doing other (:3) relationship things but you failed to  meditate well it is okay and more or less inevitable at some point just do your  best tomorrow to allocate spacetime for this okay as for the driving lesson you managed to perform very well today after two months  of absence you made no mistakes for the first hour of driving then you started  hurrying and things got a little worse but ive got nothing that cant be managed  by practice and money for the practice i got plenty :) morning observations: the reason for me not doing meditation and vocal practice in  the morning is simply that when i wake up it is very difficult for me to  physically stand up my mood is down because of my physical condition and it is  way harder to trick your body into instantly changing state than your mind mind is  a tricky beast but it can be tricked fairly easily if you believe you can do it :)  98 july 27 [ meditate  ; hidden 39/2 ] same morning same observations i really need to learn to allocate some other time  for vocal exercises and meditational activities what might be better definitely  not evening because im more likely just to go to sleep instead of meditating  truly and probably not the middle of the day (on the regular basis) because im  in no mood to explain to amin what kind of sounds im extracting out of my poor  throat the only thing that remains is the morning so ill have to repurpose my  day probably going to bed even earlier to be able to wake up earlier that would  be exactly like having these exercises in the evening but with an effect for the  whole day hmm makes sense just a meaningless entry to add up to the body of text i will be having at some  point when teaching my personal exocortex have fun live your life to the fullest  learn new things that are fun keep your relationships closer to you do whats  meaningful to you and to the ones you love the next step in producing this network is trying to formulate my own thoughts in a  way that are useful to solve the kind of problem i intend to put my network to use  to im not exactly sure though what ill be using it for (neither am i in my  ability to produce it anyway) but that is the direction you should be thinking  in  what will you need from the algorithm when you get it  99 july 28 [ meditate  ; hidden 40/0 ] a third day without meditation at 00:30 it is quite useless to meditate so im  going to skip today as well what can i do i just need to admit that i sold  todays and tomorrows meditation for todays time to code for a while i think it  was worthwile if i keep practicing meditational tricks on a daily basis (the one  with the stone and the one with prerehearsal) i think everything will be alright  when i come back it is useful to have logs you can always look up what you finished on my previous  attempts to meditate didnt have access to their corresponding predecessors and i  was starting all over again every time when you have logs you dont have to  100 july 29 [ meditate  ; hidden 41/1 ] you managed to skip the one hundredth day of your diary :) did not skip a day  before and now you did :0 spent some time playing terraria ania and dima didnt like it i think not all  the games are created equal when it comes to having a short session within couple  hours it also didnt help that me and gleb just went off to some other place and  did not promote team play in any way so that means that we are also partially  responsible for the failure that we are upset about  101 july 30 [ meditate  ; hidden 42/2 ] we are now going to play minecraft and im rather worried it is going to be the  same thing with my mods otherwise it is just not very pleasing to spent such a  time into thinking through your mods and not get any grateful feedback( im at anias dacha how the fuck am i supposed to do my vocal exercises if i dont  get alone quality time and even if i didnt travel to anias place i would have  probably traveled to my own dacha which does not offer the same kind of space  either does family life look like this when you cant arrange for time you are  completely alone  102 july 31 [ meditate  ; hidden 43/3 ] unfortunately didnt produce any diary entries no time for entering personal mood  when you are constantly interrupted and when the environment is unfit for personal  time  103 august 1 [ meditate  ; hidden 44/4 ] it is quite pitiful what anias dacha makes from me only 2 days is enough to turn  me into a vegetable i agree it is your responsibility to keep you fit for  fruitful (haha) activities but you cant argue that in some places it is much more  difficult to do than in the others things started to get better almost immediately as soon as i entered my room im  planning to spend next half an hour repairing my mental state and then ill  bravely meet tomorrow i will renew my meditation sessions starting tomorrow ill probably try to do  them in the office why not## after neural  104 august 2 [ meditate x ; hidden 45/0 ] had quite a confident driving lesson looks very much like a start of a productive  day it has been quite a productive day indeed i did not do much engineering but i  definitely helped the cogs of our startup turn when you are at a leadership  position you really act more like a support you should not value your  contribution based on direct evidence only anymore i missed my keyboard a lot it did not deserve spending nights in the office  without me its clicking sound in my private chambers certainly does have a calming  and relaxing effect i might even get interested in purchasing one with blue  switches some day and im resuming meditation  105 august 3 [ hidden 46/1 ] got a book that according to amin he used to learn speaking convincingly in  public will look through it got back from work and more or less managed to get work issues out of my head  straight away i wonder whether it was because of me getting better at isolating  private time or because of work issues being boring and irrelevant to my  development got my first big salary today though) it was also relieving to hear that i have an army backup plan from amin it is  useful to think about backup plans early been thinking about computer games and came to a somewhat strong conclusion it is  no doubt that you have many great experiences from videogames which you recall  every so often and which you are very glad to have in your memory but it makes  absolutely no sense to force yourself to play one  as you recently discovered you  `almost want` to play screeps minecraft terraria and caves of qud `almost want`  means that you had to give yourself an extra additional push to start playing so  that makes no sense if you have a burning desire  then go ahead but if you are  just unwilling to do anything playing will just probably prolong that apathy  period because once you leave the game you will be mentally punishing yourself for  wasting time not enjoying a great experience decided to omit even the meditation log instead decided to track every goal in a  separate phone application that will allow me to remove any duplication i have in  this diary + in separate mini diaries dedicated to particular activity and it is  easier to maintain noticed that my muscles at the area where i think my diaphragm is located are  unnaturally tense it lasted for several hours and did not stop even as i went to  sleep maybe general physical exercise will help  106 august 4 [ hidden 47/0 ] had quite an unpleasant driving lesson  constantly made mistakes of different  kinds my instructor was of course quite straightforward and did not try to make  it an easier experience but by being prepared for failures i was able to not fall  into a bad mood after the lesson at all i was able to perform at work straight  away only 30 minutes after the end of the lesson being prepared and having  adjusted expectations is good worried about my driving with some internal struggle i admit that hours i spend  learning to drive are not wasted and it does not matter much if i pass the  examination now or a year later however keeping this in your head constantly is  difficult and i sometimes succumb to fear and feeling of momentary unpleasantness  from the whole thing remember no ticker watching youll pass it someday as for  the cost you only have to work a week and you already cover almost everything you  paid for the whole endeavour so even if you drop it i think you still have gained  more than you have lost another lesson  dont really drag your unpleasant responsibilities up to a point  when it is painful executing them i dragged driving lessons for longer than i  really needed and im just finishing my mandatory hours right when i possibly need  to move to saint petersburg again action send medical notes to your lor doctor  tomorrow and visit him within a week so all in all it turns out i have nothing to worry about both in a short run and in  the long one diploma driving work army  all these things are more or less  under my control and nothing will ruin my life im already on the way of personal  development that i quite enjoy  107 august 5 [ hidden 48/0 ] spent an evening with ania played some minecraft and ordered delicious food  didnt have much will to fill in the diary though  108 august 6 [ hidden 49/1 ] had a beautiful evening at the office maybe you should really come here tomorrow  it looks like you are really able to concentrate here if you will so why not you are really agitated while listening to divinity lost songs that is not what  you are after how about a little conscious interruption and setting you body  condition to required one i would really love to stay in here if it was not for talking to ania im feeling  this state i got myself into has the potency to provide a substantial work push  109 august 7 [ hidden 50/2 ] started to read `harry potter and the methods of rationality` i must have been  lucky to get to read it once more when im in the period of life rationalization  myself it will cover most biases again the stuff that is covered in  `thinking in bets` and it is full of interesting revelations for instance the only way to fight optimistic planning bias is asking not  `how long it you think will take` but `how long it took last time you did that`  however if you are new to the subject the only way must be being really really  pessimistic had a very intense argument with my mother and my books told me and i didnt  listen willing to do all this rationalization i completely lost the idea of other  people not willing to do the same dont expect other people to be rational expect  them to be irrational especially if they are emotionally attached to you and are  30 years older for gods sake it is perhaps inevitable that defying parental opiniton violates their tribal  status you will just have to admit that you will need to operate without  quarelling with mom all the time she is kind caring and such but you will never  get a chance to be worth actually listened to younger and therefore subhuman  110 august 8 [ hidden 51/3 ] purchased some new mouse pad with two evillooking eyes feels quite ominous i  can now imagine that is the new hidden entity inside me who wishes to take over the  world continued to read hpmor only lesser techniques require targets unawareness of an  influence greater techniques touch such humble string in your soul that they force  you to take an opponents side even fully realizing youve been manipulated what  a great book makes me want to take over the world finally took some time to fix my old vim problems fixed nerdtree changed  statusline to more configurable did some cool mappings to resize splits and jump  over tabs i feel the need to clean up my setup once more dont know why i did not  do this earlier  111 august 9 [ hidden 52/0 ] todo fill later on the driving hysteria cried in front of my instructor  112 august 10 [ hidden 53/1 ] had a wonderful evening with ania making burgers had a bit of a dissapointment a  bit later of intimate kind i wonder what to you need to do if you feel rejected  it is kind of unblameable to ania because she got what she wanted but how do i  need to behave i felt so frustrated and dumped that day that i was unable to act  to move out of this state a painful experience  113 august 11 [ hidden 54/2 ] had quite a bad evening because of not being unable to fully shake off the effect  of yesterday being in front of another person that was the root of the issue kind  of reminded me to be sad thats too bad im pretty sure that at home you  wouldnt have spent this evening that badly bottom line: if the environment does  not work for you try escaping it  114 august 12 [ hidden 55/0 ] had a great evening at home purchased a `fireship` access for corporate money  going to enjoy the nextjs course that has many peculiarities like ssr and oh so  many new js frameworks love js frameworks  115 august 13 [ hidden 56/1 ] had a long day at work where it felt like i broke more than i fixed however i  introduced prepush merged a lot of work into master discussed db with ania  (finally she is content with what she is doing thank god) watched a redux video  had a bryden class it was a good day dont blame yourself had spent some time to start going through the course but didnt really do much  condition you know remember about your physical condition spending time does not  translate to outcome directly i think youd manage to understand all of what  youve listened to today for half the time  116 august 14 [ hidden 57/2 ] unfortunately became ill and did not have quite a productive day visited three  secondhands purchased two things but ultimately not sure whether it was worth the  time remember that your impact depends on your condition  117 august 15 [ hidden 58/3 ] visited my granny i really should pay more attention to this side of my family  ive previously contacted my dad one and a half months ago this is really  terrifying i should call him once he gets back had helped dasha to kickoff a good birthday im pretty sure i managed to help her  have a good time in the morning good boy mental pat again anias university starts driving me crazy now im supposed to hold in my  head everything about her probability theory examination but i must that is one  of the lesser things i could do for her feeling myself better today i think tomorrow is going to be an illfree day  118 august 16 [ hidden 59/0 ] was feeling ill but spent some quality time in the evening to learn cool telescope  features registered on twitter made my first twitter post now i feel i should  have done it a long time ago started sponsoring open source it just feels right ive had so many pleasant  experiences that it only feels honest to pay something back to the people i like i  think i will be increasing my payment because money at this stage are a bit more  flexible to give away already and my time still feels valuable i believe that i  have to continue working for a while and when ill feel even more empowered ill  move to something like open source time will tell i guess world is such an  interesting place the constant stream of new information flowing into the world is  simply exhilarating  119 august 17 [ hidden 0/0 ] unfortunately broke my hidden goal completely had become completely sick and skipped my day at work ania came to spend some time  with me and im deeply grateful to her  she brought me many tasty things and had  shown her care in many other means  120 august 18 [ hidden 0/0 ] spent my whole evening messing with terraform deeply enjoyed it not regretful  about not writing much into the diary even a tiny bit learned that you had different words in english to express agreement and  disagreement for example you say `im sure as well` and you also say  `im not sure either` what is interesting is that you cannot say `im sure either`  and `im not sure as well`  121 august 19 [ hidden 1/0 ] tabnine really eats the battery away for an hour half of the battery is gone this  is just ridiculous i need to find a way to switch it off when using battery power had spent yet another great deal of time learning about terraform again not  regretful had spent three hours of quality time with ania we discussed an important problem  of clothes and the very fact of discussion seemed to bring us together even if  for an evening only it was still very valuable afterwards i had a conversation with mom and she helped me to figure out what  exactly was wrong with how ania currently wears things she likes: skinny things  shiny things things that are specifically for girls (in a time where fashion  becomes especially asexual) things like decoltes are simply out of her age it is  in fashion right now to wear lousy and comfortable clothes it is not in fashion  now to come to ther theater in a long and skinny dress (by skinny i mean that it  wraps your figure up and you specifically address the fact that you are a woman  look at me everybody that is just (a bit) vulgar) even so i need to tell her these things in a soft manner moreover word wars are  highly unlikely to change anything if i am ever to truly win i will have to start  buying her things that are at least the tiny bit closer to my inner standards of  beauty than it is now that is the ultimate goal right not make her wear only the  stuff i want but to become happy for both of us to become content with ourselves  and our partner  122 august 20 [ hidden 2/1 ] had quite an intensive quarrel with masha on protecting the guys looks like i  managed to make my point quite peacefully i hope so at least had some quality rest time in the evening with ania purchased a new keyboard and  talked politics  123 august 21 [ hidden 3/2 ] have been injected with a first shot of sputnik v makes me feel good that i  finally realized it would be a sensible thing to do but probably too late ive  been convinced with some unverified stories from doctors that ive never heard from  in person maybe they were right but i think the weighted probability of coming  to harm from not taking it outweighs the probability of coming to harm taking it your power as a rationalist lies in being more confused by fiction than by reality had a long and extensive talk with ania that started on fashion and slowly moved  onto goals in life i think i made a good point about us sharing a common set of  goals for us willing to do good as a couple as opposed to individual regular  goals each one of us has had literally written "haves" instead of "has" in the previous sentence maybe  because the vaccine was russian  124 august 22 [ hidden 4/3 ] my first attempt of filling the diary for the tomorrow day i do that for the fear  of feeling terrible because of the vaccine most probably i will spend my day  recovering and not really taking down anything important well lesson learned  there will be times in your life when your physical condition will dictate your  momentary behaviour had been taking notes for the third of the year when you explicitly notice in what  ways had you become better it is much less worrying to think about your future  im rather proud with you egor for taking it this far you will definitely not  manage to try all the activities for your selfdevelopment that you can think of  but it is worth reminding that there are only 24 hours in a day and there is such  a thing as `good enough` im not embarassed to sit next to ibragim or dima  gnatyuk not anymore had been reading hpmor for probably too much ive started to skip the finest  moments of rational thinking just to advance the plot and im not happy that it is  happening therefore ill adjust my speed artificially everything in this world  should be consumed at an appropriate pace  125 august 23 [ hidden 5/0 ] spent a good evening playing with tolya and coding i really do believe in 10x  programmer performers and this will be a lifegoal accomplished if i manage to do  something cool utilizing my powers of course im not yet a topperformer i have  yet too little experience but i have a strong sense of direction and i feel im  gaining this experience quite rapidly comparing to tolya it feels like im  finally starting to level with him  126 august 24 [ hidden 6/1 ] feeling confused by work and ania and necessity to do things tomorrow and by  uncertainty of the uni at work  you will just have to draw the line between your time and work time  understand that work problems are left at work your time is too precious to think  of them you will think of them when the time comes you are only allowed to work  in your free time if it is extremely enjoyable or educational or both you have several hours today left it would be unwise to just ditch them and do  nothing so i plan to get up brew myself a cup of hot tea impose some  shortlasting order onto my room read a book for a while have a meditation  session if i feel like it all this stress even made me stutter more i should be  probably resting more and i should certainly start fixing things with ania which ill do by calling her  in 15 minutes i tried really hard but i did not succeed in behaving in a friendly manner i was  just a little bit selfish but that was enough to turn the whole conversation to an  absolutely undesidered hostility  127 august 25 [ hidden 7/2 ] had a bryden lesson im glad i keep training in intellectual things im not that  bothered with driving because i know i can master it  it is a shallow skill and  therefore i can postpone it almost indefinitely but intellectual skills are almost  always infinitely deep meaning that you will find it enjoyable to operate an  intellectual skill at any level because there will always be able something more  complex than what you can already comprehend all this shallow\deep talk is by the  way from `designing games` by tynan sylvester a great book that is specifically  about games but also helps in modeling many interactions with the world there are so called `sequences` composed by the author of harry potter and the  methods of rationality eliezer yudkowsky instead of trying to absorb as much  devops instruments as i can i might start learning to learn using these materials  start with `how to actually change your mind` learned a wonderful feature of vim if you needed to navigate command line there  are controlbased movements and you could open up a buffer with full vim navigation  over your history again the lesson if you need something desperately and realize  that you are not the first and not the only one to have that problem then it was  solved eons ago  128 august 26 [ hidden 8/3 ] had a very rough day with ania totally wasted really what are the relationship  where you try to convince your partner to not go and do something with yourself  is it not the definition of toxic however i realize how hard was ania trying  to help me how hard she was trying to boost my mood how generous she had been  after ive listed all the reasons to be upset about but really im not loggingfit now i just need to go to sleep right now finish  this later okay think of ways to fix this  129 august 27 [ hidden 9/4 ] had a helpful talk with serezha on my relationship problems he could understand  me because he had an experience that is even worse than mine his did not end  well there was no one by his side to help him and he had higher responsibilities  at work which was much more stressful than mine is anyway hed been able to talk  to mom and now it seems if im not leaving for saintpetersburg im renting a flat  with ania that is quite a big step and this is literally final in how things will  be in real life if this does not turn out well im afraid i will really need to  think of my relationships  130 august 28 [ hidden 10/5 ] purchased a small notebook wrapped into some leatherlike soft to the touch  wrapping with a vinyl disk on top got me thinking  if an average notebook costs  several hundred roubles and my current rate per hour is about 600 and each  purchased notebook stimulates several concentrated thinking sessions just because  of their novelty that automatically means that it is worth purchasing these  notebooks even if you will sit down to use them only so many times spent an evening in a quiet and pleasant manner making meat on the open fire and  reading a book and playing divinity with tolya  131 august 29 [ hidden 10/5 ] spent a day at anias read books visited a plant tradeground and purchased a  small pine tree for the dacha  132 august 30 [ hidden 10/6 ] even had enough time to spend playing enter the gungeon for some reason playing  on the console has some additional feeling of submersion like only because it is a  device solely intended for playing it is somewhat more comfortable and you dive  deeper into the game had a talk with masha and amin it is a good thing not to be the first but rather  visit their gatherings once in a while having fun on all the meetings and yet  doing no hard work of management i despise im having talks about people about  planning about budgeting and that happens only once in a while so i dint get  bored and really borin job is getting done by other people is it not the startu  startup heaven you imagined not even mentioning the fact that you will be doing  what is interesting to you and not what other people are made to do i feel bad  about making ania do frontend though i wonder if i should have been more  protective but she must give reason to be noticed by amin and masha in a positive  way just being loud is a huge downside not an upside you get noticed more but  on worse occasions it troubles me the flow of thought that is required for the diary does not actually  flow when im at anias place even though i sometimes get enough time and im  explicitly given a permission to do whatever i want to do the flow of thought just  does not keep coming for the fear it could be interrupted at any given minute  133 august 31 [ hidden 11/7 ] not much going on on the personal side of things im literally at work (not  working note that) 10 hours per day and by the time im back home and done some  daily activities it is time to go back to sleep again had some good time though playing it takes two with ania and then reading a book  and then just composing my thoughts before going to sleep the later it is in the day the more difficult it is to perform even the easiest  activities like typing from this naturally arises the question  is it sensible to  work out all the complex decisions in the evening is it safe to plan your work  activities your personal activities before going to bed surely it is the most  convenient time since nobody distracts you but the quality of decisions may be  lowered irreversibly by the days fatigue i weep over how terrible people are at education and information processing there  is an ocean of information of solid good life information right in front of me  carefully composed by the people i trust and respect and im biologically  incapable of processing it over the course of my entire lifetime let alone of  applying it anyhow i admit that im in a sort of romantic state of mind after  reading through a large chunk of hpmor but i believe this book has a potential of  permanently changing the way i think on the other hand my brain also does a pretty good job at solidifying all the  information i simply toss into it for example the hpmor book is a good supplement  for thinking in bets because it develops the topic of cognitive biases and repeats  certain nuggets of thought from the book  134 september 1 [ hidden 11/7 ] even managed to play some enter the gungeon for an hour it is quite a good evening  when you leave work early (pay attention you feel that you leave work early when  you actually sat there for 8 full hours and you still think about work at home :)  quite a symptom is it not)  135 september 2 [ hidden 12/8 ] a day at work masha and amin brought lego i was forced to get up from work and  participate in these team building activities however i got a fine harry potter  specimen out of it he will help me to achieve a desired level of mental awareness  136 september 3 [ hidden 13/9 ] had a great day at dacha prepared meat on open fire during a heavy rain aka  playing a barricade with my body was totally worth it visited a forest for the second time brought a second piece of birch bark as a  reminder to continue my story on selfawareness  137 september 4 [ hidden 14/10 ] gone to have a weekend with my dad had a great weekend  communicated to ania that  i would be absent which allowed me to stay calm and not to obsess about me being  hurt if i cease answering for a couple of hours i guess she grows more resilient  to it already in the early days she wouldnt have accepted that bargain i think started playing rimworld again god that felt so good i can definitely say that  this weekend was worth it i did not think about work for at least three days  straight i wonder whether it is benecificial or detrimental to my short/pong term  job productivity had a sauna at my fathers dacha i spent around 57 minutes there usually but it  was such a cold weather that i sat there for at least half an hour before i just  felt warm enough ridiculous but pleasant experience  138 september 5 [ hidden 15/11 ] spent my day (and partially night) playing rimworld it was expanded quite heavily  while i was absent for a couple of years and im pleased with how indie game  development works these days updates just dont stop coming i just cant help but  wonder whether it is that smooth from the other side you must be really focused  on your idea so as not to abandon it after a year or two of development especially  if you do this all by yourself anyway happily for me and for the majority of  population of earth these people exist who create these masterpieces i consider a  masterfully done computer game a masterpiece several levels higher than a beautiful  work of art or at least drastically different but nevertheless very important in  the comparison with other works of art it requires mental job well done and it is  a good property of a persons success in technological era too bad we do not have  age reversal machinery yet brought back from dads a set of plastic bags specifically designed to produce ice  it has an intricate reverse vault that does not allow water back after you poured  it into a meshlike bag structure dont think ill actually need this though why  hadnt you refused even back then you knew you was not going to use it it just  felt simpler to take it and to be done with it anyway im going to show this  to ania at least for the technological marvel if not for any use came back at home only to realize that i already had some lecture and some homework  due today almost due yesterday of course i dropped it it was no good to ruin my  present motivation to do anything but ill need to slowly roll back into  university life i do not wish to end up like other losers who just dropped  everything and still lived in online mark sheets long afterwards with solid zeroes  and all the teachers wondering whether these people will be present at all this is  shameful i really need to just go to bed right now but i linger trying to remember whether  i actually need to write something else down dumping the brain context is really  useful i guess  139 september 6 [ hidden 16/0 ] spent a whole day at work then at anias place then playing rimworld i really  need to end this like within a couple of days my university goes to shit i have  a ton of stuff to do already and im not starting to do any of it simply because  im too caught up in rimworld this might be the worst thing that will happen to  you during this semester please heed my advice  140 september 7 [ hidden 17/1 ] rimworld is really destroying my sleep schedule i guess last time it was with  divinity and im rather afraid that rimworld is not a small game either you can  stack these bionic arms and ears indefinitely i guess the most balanced solution  would be to come to endgame as quickly as possible it would employ both my will  to play a game with a challenge and will be a smart decision in terms of time ill  have to spend on it trying bryden two times per week for the first time i wonder whether it will be  useful or it will just be resources burning with no real value i guess the best  thing i can do is try to make them separate from each other within a week and have  a look at how it goes i have no metric to establish whether im doing great or  not but im afraid that i have no way of establishing it quickly anyway calculation of the second part of the hidden goal overcomplicates things i no  longer want to do it  141 september 8 [ hidden 18 ]  142 september 9 [ hidden 19 ]  143 september 10 [ hidden 20 ] ive finished reading harry potter and the methods of rationality first let me  ponder that if such pieces of art exist in the world then what else majestically  interesting does the world contain the world is literally an infinitely deep well  for me to learn i believe it creates knowledge and skill faster than i will be  able to manage learning and it is a fact exciting in itself unfortunately i hold no illusions on me having the same level of importance in the  history of the world as harry potter had in the history of humankind but that is  not a necessarily bad thing if humanity could produce people like me and more  importantly even better people that makes me proud of humankind and intrinsically  willing to be a part of it humans are erroneous prone to failures and biases  untrustworthy sly miserable and smallish or absent in their ambitions goals and  desires but a life within the humankind is definitely a life worth living it is  simply interesting enough if not for anything else that being said i do rather regret not having the same mental capacity as harry  potter did have in the book although it all comes down to actually doing something  applying your consciousness than letting age and experience do everything  automatically although they do help of course they may probably even be a  required but not sufficient prerequisite although the book itself did explain  quite logically that harrys advantages were set up for him not by him i cannot  transcend my personal feeling of envy at this point at least i can hope it will  help me to actually think about my life think not running on autopilot think  willing to accomplish something great i believe i have the role the same that  hermione has in the end of the book she is not strictly a hero she told that her  intention was to do what she could do accounting for the fact that she was human  after all but she was honest and she was willing to do great things i wish i  could have the taste of this `to be defended and protected expecto patronum`  thing but i must confess i do not seem worthy to myself to have this kind of  responsibility by the way do not feel guilty about the money your father gives you at this  moment my resolution is solid that i should just take this as one of the advantages  that were given to me during my path i believe my father could be my mysterious  old wizard he is mysterious at times he is indeed older than i am he provides  valuable lessons that i did not believe at first due to my childish naivety i  cannot deny his intelligence even though i cannot strictly prove it at the time of  the writing i would love to see people in the world disappear just as dumbledore  did putting himself into a mysterious cage of time itself with no understanding of  whether he will ever be back or whether anyone at all will be able to bring him  back but i digress bottom line  i am genuinely impressed with the sheer quality of the  book in terms of its intellectual capacity even though i could see that this  quality must have been backed up with time as well as with raw starting  intelligence another lesson  think through your genious ideas for months if you  have to and then give them to other people like it was a spur of the moment thing  a human brain just cannot comprehend what fraction of your creations true  greatness is your effort and what is your initial ability you should go back to your studying and development in general you have a career  to pursue where you have chances to succeed within a reasonably low amount of time  you have your human qualities to hone such as your decision making and your  rationality and your relationship management you have people around that exist to  make your life more interesting make their life interesting as well i am honestly  very pleased with what you are becoming boy it is such a pity i will never be able to visit the vast amount of information and  interesting things that i note around myself if it takes me several weeks to go  through a complicated book while reading it up until 3 in the morning every night  during these weeks i will in no way be able to process these volumes of  information in my entire life well then that just makes it even more interesting  you have to find stuff that will prove most valuable \ interesting \ both valuable  and interesting and do so quickly solve ps since for the last week ive been extremely into the book and by sheer  coincidence into a game that waged an allout war for my attention and collectively  managed to destroy my university diarykeeping and other selftending processes  consider this long conclusion as "im sorry" to the diary i will leave the days  where i did not fill in anything just empty in the memory of days gone ultimately  for the greater good  144 september 11 [ hidden 21 ] did my second shot had some fever in the night ive forgotten how it feels to be  sick how your muscles ache all the time how foggy is your head thats good im  more or less healthy most of the time be grateful for your health  145 september 12 [ hidden 22 ] by writing such words im signing my own death sentence because anya will read it  at some point anyway but im deeply frustrated by our incompatibility we  literally seem to deride favourite books tv series movies clothes and computer  games of each other we cannot comprehend each others motivation in certain kinds  of actions and the most painful thing is that no one is really guilty it is just  natural incompatibility i feel like im forced to do things i dont like all the  time while ania sincerely thinks she is trying to make our time together better by  proposing interesting content too bad it is only interesting for her and of  course i cannot blame her for it im heavily frustrated and i dont know what to  do because in order to come closer to each other interests we will need to force  ourselves to do things we dont naturally like and the other partner would feel  guilty for making other person feel unpleasant maybe this is how life works in general maybe i will have friends to discuss  things i like and then ill come home and essentialy treat my wife with neutrality  because we dont have much to talk about except for common house responsibilities  and daily routine this is devastating it is sad that i was not able to hold myself back from making an argument with ania  in the evening i completely realize that it did no good and that we would both be  better off without this argument for nothing because we were able to predict how  it would end rational books ive been reading lately recommend that i do not grief over whats  happening but rather search for solutions how to fix the situation but it is  difficult and im not always able to master my own feelings but im proud of  myself for being able to do this last night when i had a deep talk with ania on  why she suddenly burst and left be in the bed alone for using my laptop i managed  not to burn and managed to forgive managed to express love in the middle of a  heated argument and that went well becoming a better person does not mean  overcoming biases and irrationality completely just reducing them by any nonzero  margin is already an important result i hope i will be able to continue like that  too bad hpmor ended it was quite an inspiration to do better
