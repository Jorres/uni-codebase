the earth was headed straight for another major war , 
for a longer time than most men had allotted to them , 
but not more than once or twice . 
funny about ulysses , he thought , who had lived just down the road - 
and how long had it been , he thought . 
poor pitiful half - creatures , he thought , there might be no time when any creature 
or any group of creatures could stop at any certain point and say , 
this is as far as we can go , there is no need , it seems to .
