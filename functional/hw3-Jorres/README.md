# hw3-Jorres

## How to run
There is a `bexec.sh` script in the root directory, it builds and runs the resulting executable.

## Some key points
The code has been formatted via ormolu, as it has been advised by one of the teachers, George Agapov. I hope there would be no points reduction for the code style :\ 

The test filesystem is pure. I really hope that it is what had been expected from us

The test filesystem uses lens and traversal almost everywhere to modify\read itself.
