# hw4-Jorres

### benchmarking 
reports generated by criterion on performance are available in `report-integral.html` 
for the task with the integral and in `report-geom.html` for the task with strict geometry.

### Comonad19 specific
Monitoring of this task is done with `stack test` but you have to comment all the 
other test invocations for convenience.  In `src/Spec.hs` change this:
```haskell
main = do
    mainGeometrySpec
    mainIntegratingSpec
--  mainComonad19Spec
```

to that:
```haskell
main = do
--  mainGeometrySpec
--  mainIntegratingSpec
    mainComonad19Spec
```

I know I should have done multiple build targets but alas 
I didn't have enough time to figure how to do it.
