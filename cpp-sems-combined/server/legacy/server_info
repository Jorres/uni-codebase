UDP or TCP
different ports
http - 80
https - 443
port is basically a data queue
< 1024 considered to be service ports
>= 1024 free for usage
// 3238
IP address - net card, not the device itself

bsd socket - family of functions to communicate via network

CLIENT
int s = socket(); // sort of file descriptor - key for OS
// default state - not connected
connect(s, remote_address, ...);

read/write(); // polymorphic
recv/send(); // socket specialization

close(s); // closing file descriptor

SERVER
int s = socket();
bind(s, local_address, ...); // which card and port listens to
// bind (0.0.0.0:0); // choose port on your own
listen(s, ...);

int c = accept(s); // gets a connected dude from os queue

    loop:
    read/write/send/recv
    close(c);

close(s);

lsof -i -P
strace
telnet

poll - api for checking who is ready to read or write
accept counts as read

after write do poll again

poll after each write is not perfect

switch non block - read does not block, just sort of returns an empty state

// SIGNALS lecture
    volatile // <-- should never be used in life
    single use - to be able to address it from signal handler
    volatile bool quit = false;
    and some other hardcore implementations we will never need - basically command to compiler to do nothing with it

    can call some posix functions (write read)
